barbie	TrueFilm	15o67bb	1691752936	Barbie and patriarchy	"I'm going to post my write-up about Barbie here, which was initially intended for an Instagram audience. So, while my write-up isn't going to break any new ground or be as in-depth as it could be, I think it's a still fruitful topic to think about and discuss. 

While Barbie is a movie for women first and
foremost (and I don't mean to take away from that in any shape or form) I do appreciate that Barbie still offers something quite important and interesting to the discourse of masculinity as subtext. And since I am a man, I thought I would comment on what I know.

So Ken, for all intents and purposes, is a stand-in for boys (edit: by boys, I'm referring to male children, not men as a whole). Like literally a manchild. He's immature, he's jealous, etc. He basically acts like the stereotypical primary (elementary) school boy. But more importantly, he feels disempowered, stemming from the fact that he is pretty much rejected romantically. When he goes to the real world, he is promised a solution in the patriarchy. That is the only thing he has to look up to in terms of images of male success. Thus, his idea of success is now skewed by a system he doesn't realise yet is literally built on sexism.

This patriarchal society basically radicalises him. It tells him that if he performs masculinity in the way the world wants, he will be rewarded with whatever he wants. He brings that mindset back to his world and tries to emulate all of what he's seen.

But the patriarchy doesn't work in helping him get what he wants because, of course, it doesn't. Him trying to be this controlling alpha male, and disenfranchising all the women in Barbieland only brings distress and sadness to Barbie. And all of this macho masculinity stuff he thought was so cool doesn't really end up filling the hole within himself that he was trying to fill with Barbie. He's alone in a (stolen) house with nothing.

This is basically the same arc that many men (especially incels) basically go through. There's a disconnect between what's promised of traditional patriarchy and what the actual results are. Just because you do everything ""a man does"" doesn't mean you'll be rewarded with the typical rewards patriarchy portrays: a beautiful wife, expensive house, or even general respect, etc. Even if you are rewarded with the things patriarchy tells you you should want, it doesn't guarantee that any of this will offer any fulfilment or contentment. It's this disconnect that drives dangerous men towards committing mass shootings as an act of reclaiming power at its worst, and at its best, leads to a philosophy of ""nothing matters"" AKA passive nihilism.

Obviously, in the Barbie movie, Ken didn't go to those lengths (it would be a very different movie if he did). But you can still see this disconnect playing out in the movie.

The line that Ken is ""enough"" becomes very important in this context since many boys aren't really told that when they are younger. He can't find happiness in Barbie, nor can he find it in pretending to be something he's not. He can only find it in himself. In the end, he let go of all the self-help alpha male redpill bullshit and just decided that he should be himself, and that should be enough.

It's a lesson for all men, really. Too many men try to define themselves in their relationships or in how well they perform masculinity. And that mindset is damaging not only to everyone around these men but to the men who subscribe to this thinking themselves. It is an unnecessary self inflicted burden. More men and boys need to realise that they are enough, and they can be happy.

Sidenote: it's this reason why the idea that Barbie is anti-men really pisses me off because it's nowhere close to that. Barbie is anti-patriarchy. There is a difference. To equate men to patriarchy is to equate men to a system that also hurts them. Patriarchy hurts everyone. So, if anything, an anti-patriarchy (or feminist) message is inherently pro-men, not anti-men. It places that men not as the whole system but as individual actors who are capable of rejecting patriarchal hegemony. IE men can (emphasis on can) be awesome... if we let them. 

Sidenote 2: A lot of my thoughts on this movie come from [this video](https://youtu.be/s1FkO7Tr70A) by FD Signifier. He talks about the manosphere in general, but a lot of what he covers can also be applied to Ken. He is an amazing video essayist, I recommend you check him out if you're interested.

indiana_jones	movies	1p5dhjn	1763979694	What are some movie series that should have stayed trilogies?	A lot of folks talk about how some movies didn't need a sequel and should have stayed one-and-done. However, there are many cases where the initial trilogy is beloved, but the fourth film was a step too far. This could either be because it was unnecessary, bad, or retroactively ruined the characters and story. Some examples include Indiana Jones, Toy Story, Pirates of the Caribbean, (arguably) Star Wars, The Lord of the Rings, etc. What other series would you include in this category?	/r/movies/comments/1p5dhjn/what_are_some_movie_series_that_should_have/	https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1p5dhjn/what_are_some_movie_series_that_should_have/	
indiana_jones	movies	1ljhebi	1750786288	Non spoiler review: Fountain of Youth	"Good artists copy; great artists steal. It's fitting for a movie about tomb raiders to rip off every action-adventure movie and game to come out in the past 40 years. Fountain of Youth is a new movie on Apple TV+ that skips the nods to its influences and instead straight-up steals scenes and overall plot points as if no one would notice. Early on, it's more of ""haha, that was straight out of Indiana Jones!"" Yet later it becomes harder to forgive. One scene in particular: the characters are scanning famous paintings to find hidden codes. The creators must think no one ever played Assassin's Creed II (even with it being one of the biggest games of that generation), as this scene is nearly shot-for-shot stolen from that game. Who the fuck am I to say anything? I'm a dude, watching another dude, for other dudes to read!

 Horror and action-adventures are my favorite genres, so I feel if anything, I'm going to be more lenient than most. I could watch the Indiana Jones original trilogy on repeat! The Tomb Raider trilogy is a massive part of my childhood memories, and the Uncharted GAMES continued that into my teens! Globe-trotting adventures are deeply ingrained in my personality. I won't tell you never to watch this again, don't bother, or it's cringeworthy all the way through. I don't feel that bad about this film; it's entertaining, but I can recognize it's not the best that the genre can offer. 

The Crew Views

 Written by James Vanderbilt, it doesn't give much of a clue as to the value of this movie. Some of his writing credits are downright great: Zodiac and The Rundown. Yet others are downright garbage: Independence Day: Resurgence and Murder Mystery. This guy has talent, but I can never tell if it's going to be a script for himself or a paycheck. Something that piqued my interest early on was this film being directed by Guy Ritchie. Every Guy Ritchie film I see makes me want to go through his catalog, though I'll probably just watch Sherlock Holmes again. His style is all over Fountain of Youth, making the action and fight scenes unbelievably well shot with the camera and action choreography working in tandem, rather than quick cutting different angles together.

At Least One Actor Cared

  There’s a host of characters in Fountain of Youth, but only two of them in fact matter. John Krasinski is our main protagonist. Luke, an ""antiquities finder"" (tomb raider), is just charming and funny enough to keep your eyes on the screen during expository moments, but also detracts from some of the tension of the action sequences. His constant schemes to escape situations get old quite quickly. At one point, Luke escapes a shootout by cranking the music up quickly and throwing a sheet into the air, covering his escape. He is an upbeat character, but John Krasinski never smiles during the film. This makes me wonder if this was a character choice or if he was just miserable on set.

 Natalie Portman plays Charlotte, a museum curator trying to hold together her peaceful yet boring life, and Luke's sister. Obviously, with this dichotomy between the characters, tension is to be expected. Luke seems to not give a fuck about any consequences as it's all about the high of the journey and the next clue. Charlotte is the opposite, often coming across as the downer in the film. She's constantly berating other characters to no end, even when her own actions are questionable. In one particular moment, Charlotte tries to point out Luke's motives to him: ""So what you're really saying is you need reverence."" She is right, but explains this while getting sloppily drunk, while her son sits across from her. Hey, family is fucked up, what can you do? 

 Each actor plays their role pretty straightforwardly, but I feel that Charlotte isn't written particularly well. For Natalie, this was probably just another paycheck rather than an award winner, so she's kind of just on screen. Charlotte and Luke's back and forth is as much heart as you're going to get out of this film, and it's flimsily holding this fraudulent fuckery together. The rest of the cast are just background characters that disappear until the audience needs more exposition. There's not genuinely any antagonist, just Interpol and this organization dubbed The Protectors, but each just shows up when there hasn't been a fight sequence for a while. Truly, I try to keep these reviews as spoiler-free as possible, but if I explain anything else, you'd probably figure out the plot. It doesn't take Lara Croft to unravel this mystery. 

An Unseen Adventure We've All Seen Before

 There's not much to explain as the title does it all. One character is dying, so he builds a crew to find the Fountain of Youth. Regrettably, that all happens off-screen, so we don't see any good crew building or bonding. You may ask, ""Oh, so were they saving runtime to make it a character piece?"" Oh shit, they forgot that too! I'm not sure if sequels are planned, but there are elements introduced that are never fully explained. Look, not everything is going to last like Indiana Jones has. Fuck, even Indiana Jones couldn't keep it up! Fountain of Youth follows the adventure formula of one clue leading to another clue, and another; so on and so forth. Of course, any adventure can be boiled down to this. It's what’s in between that makes it exciting! Sadly, there's not much in between the set pieces that keeps shit interesting. 

 The bigger issues come later. The whole movie consists of different real sets throughout. With no explanation, no restraint is shown towards the end of the movie. It crosses into a full CG fuckfest while dialing up the supernatural elements. Suspension of Disbelief in film is a very fine line. Other adventure movies do this well, but with Fountain of Youth, it just feels like it jumps the shark in the final parts of the movie.

Set Pieces Mis-set My Expectations

 Fountain of Youth does get some things right and does them spectacularly! Younger viewers may not know of this term, but there are these things called sets that actors use to act on, giving them and the audience the vibe of the film. Now, everything is done in front of a fucking green screen looking unrealistic, with the confusion of the actor being portrayed on their face. Whatever reasoning was had during production, it won over the money whores and gave this movie a sense of identity. Everything is very detailed and looks amazing; from the fauna overtaking ancient areas to the stone and woodwork looking aged meticulously. Paralleled with great scores being individual to each piece, this is without a doubt the movie’s best feature. Even if the believability isn't there, the realism in the set pieces is enough to let you turn your brain off. 

 In an early sequence, Luke &amp; Charlotte are in a 427 Shelby Cobra with the police chasing them through London streets. Featuring witty banter between brother &amp; sister, comedy, and levity, all wrapped into this action sequence was top-notch! This should have set the stage for the rest of the film, but alas, it is the best part. Not to disgrace any of the other sets, as they're all done extremely well. This particular one just brought everything the movie should've been, all at once. 

Summary

 Fountain of Youth won't be winning any awards, but that doesn't mean it should be another film to just forget about. If you're a fan of the action-adventure genre, it should be a decent film to have on one night while eating dinner. It might be on the lower tier of that genre, but sometimes a fun movie is a great watch! I would say don't dare compare it to Indiana Jones, Uncharted, or even Assassin's Creed, but that will be difficult considering some scenes are straight up lifted from those franchises. The characters aren't exactly great, but the action and the set pieces are where this movie lives! There's enough here to entertain throughout its runtime while not completely engulfing the audience. In a sense, this could be a great date movie as I would probably recommend side conversation to fill in some boring gaps. Unfortunately, the wasted potential is the hardest thing to deal with. Decent cast, great director, amazing set pieces, all for not much of a return. Fountain of Youth is a decent feel-good movie bogged down by aggressive mediocrity."	/r/movies/comments/1ljhebi/non_spoiler_review_fountain_of_youth/	https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1ljhebi/non_spoiler_review_fountain_of_youth/	
indiana_jones	TrueFilm	14regw6	1688572074	In the last six months, 9 out of 13 films that have a budget of $100 Million have flopped or bombed at the box office. What does that mean in regards to the film industry? Is this is a positive or a negative outcome for the long term health of the industry?	"There have been 13 films this year that have had a budget of 100M or more. These are Ant Man 3, Shazam 2, John Wick 4, Dungeons and Dragons, Super Mario Bros, Guardians of the Galaxy 3, Fast X, Little Mermaid, Across the Spiderverse, Transformers: Rise of the Beasts, Elemental, The Flash and Indiana Jones 5. 

Out of these movies only 4 could be considered to be genuinely successful. These are John Wick 4, Mario, Guardians 3 and Spiderverse. The rest have either not been able to reach their break even point or have bombed massively. Even if they eventually are able to make their money back through ancillaries, the fact remains that they weren't able to make their money at the box office and it is unlikely that these films will either  get a sequel ( Flash, Indiana Jones) or the franchise will continue for much longer ( Transformers, Fast and Furious).

Last year most mid budget films didn't make back their money at the box office. But this year it seems even the big IP blockbusters are failing to make their money. If the Streaming Wars are coming to an end soon and Hollywood is going to have move towards an overcorrection, do you think mid budget films will make a comeback? Or is that audience now completely lost to Television?"	/r/TrueFilm/comments/14regw6/in_the_last_six_months_9_out_of_13_films_that/	https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/14regw6/in_the_last_six_months_9_out_of_13_films_that/	
barbie	movies	18vzv44	1704125486	My boyfriend loves the Barbie movie because he said it was a pink version of “2001: A Space Odyssey” and a pg version of “Brave New World”	"So my boyfriend and I watched Barbie this night (it’s his first time watching) and came to this conclusion. I haven’t seen 2001: A Space Odyssey nor read Brave New World, so could anyone enlighten or expand on the concepts to me on what exactly the parallels are?

He said that he sees themes of transcendence and evolution that’s in both movies (baby doll to Barbie doll to woman; monkey to man to giant space baby). He also mentions how it’s similar to the book for its themes of escaping a utopia and claiming the right to be unhappy. 

P.S. he strongly believes Ken is Hal and I have no further context about this opinion so I would love an explanation."	/r/movies/comments/18vzv44/my_boyfriend_loves_the_barbie_movie_because_he/	https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/18vzv44/my_boyfriend_loves_the_barbie_movie_because_he/	
mi7	movies	1g6ccgw	1729235799	I found Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning to be unwatchable	"I remember enjoying all the other films for their schlocky action and stunts. But for some reason I found this one to be unwatchable. I got through three quarters of it, all I was able to put down. The premise is ridiculous. The fight choreography is sillier than usual. The actions many of the characters make makes no sense. And although it is just me being picky, but as an ex-submariner the submarine sequence in the beginning was completely laughable. I know it isn't supposed to be realistic, but come on. You can't just turn off a torpedo remotely once there is no guidance wire connected or anything communicating with the torpedo. Sonar was of course represented by a radar screen. And the fancy 3D displays were gratuitous. 

I know these movies are supposed to be fun but it wasn't. It was just bad."	/r/movies/comments/1g6ccgw/i_found_mission_impossible_dead_reckoning_to_be/	https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1g6ccgw/i_found_mission_impossible_dead_reckoning_to_be/	
barbie	TrueFilm	1mgwry6	1754260691	We've reached the point where Citizen Kane has become an underrated movie	"I genuinely believe this. Yes I know it sounds ridiculous to say about a movie that is regarded as the best movie ever made, but it's true. I mean what was the last time you actually heard someone say Citizen Kane is the best movie ever and that they loved watching it? The prevailing sentiment these days seems to be ""It's technically impressive for its time but I thought it was boring"". Like people just watch the movie begrudgingly, because they feel like they have to, and nobody actually likes it or would put it into their favorites. Which I feel is fucking crazy because to me, it really is one of the best movies I've ever seen. I think it's a gripping story about a very interesting character, it's a great tragic character study. And you know, it's extremely well shot and directed with lots of style. In no way can I imagine it to be boring or mediocre, what is that goes wrong so often when people try to watch it today? Is it people expecting more because of its reputation? Is it just inexperienced filmbros not being used to watching movies that are fucking old and freaking out because everything is in black and white and shit? Is it the unusual (for the time, and for now) structure of the movie? Is it just old and dated, and made obsolete by modern masterpieces such as Tenet, Avengers: Infinity War and the Barbie movie? Seriously wtf is going on here?"	/r/TrueFilm/comments/1mgwry6/weve_reached_the_point_where_citizen_kane_has/	https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/1mgwry6/weve_reached_the_point_where_citizen_kane_has/

Hey guys! I love doing projects like this just for fun. I love rating and ranking movies and doing brackets. It's a real sweet spot for me. I had this idea the other day so I figured I should pursue it. How this came to be was that I took a look at the most popular movies on Letterboxd, then I split them up into the 8 genres you see above. The seeds were simply determined by how high they were on Letterboxd's popularity list. There was a little bit of fudging with the genres just to make everything fit, but I don't believe there is anything egregiously out of place. For those who want to see all of the seeds broken down, here they are...

indiana_jones	movies	1hs2m9o	1735847475	"""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" feels like it could have been an Indiana Jones entry."	"I recently watched ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" (1977) for the first time. I generally enjoyed the movie as it was. Yet part me of also thinks it could have been an Indiana Jones entry. Obviously, there isn't any ancient object to return to a museum, but it could be more of a rescue type mission. I think Indiana 4 and 5 show that type of story fits in the series. The two main characters would still exist. They'd team up with Indy to rescue the kid. 

They'd have to crack the code on where they are requesting to be met (Devil's Tower). Then you can have the sequence breaking through barricades to get past the blockade. Follow that up with the scenes of them being ""captured"" and then breaking free and sneaking up the rock formation."	/r/movies/comments/1hs2m9o/close_encounters_of_the_third_kind_feels_like_it/	https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hs2m9o/close_encounters_of_the_third_kind_feels_like_it/	
barbie	flicks	1auyp9o	1708376832	I saw Barbie again and it's even funnier the second time	"Hey all. This movie is just hilarious.

How many movie and pop culture references did you pick up on? Of course it starts with 2001: A Space Odyssey. You can see The Matrix - both the first one and Reloaded (when Barbie gets chased through the office, plus the infinite hallway).

That whole scene where they plot to take Barbie Land back from the Kens, when they play the Matchbox Twenty song (Push) is really funny. You can see the Kens riding imaginary horses (Monty Python and the Holy Grail), callouts to the Godfather, etc.

What other references did you see?

Additionally, it was worth it to see America Ferrera's rant, explaining to Barbie how hard it is to be a woman. I'm a man but, yes, I get it!

Kudos to Greta Gerwig and Noam Baumbach for such a clever script, and all the actors!"	/r/flicks/comments/1auyp9o/i_saw_barbie_again_and_its_even_funnier_the/	https://www.reddit.com/r/flicks/comments/1auyp9o/i_saw_barbie_again_and_its_even_funnier_the/	
barbie	TrueFilm	17gbdcr	1698258073	Barbie &amp; D: On the Subversion of Play	"A child aimlessly moves their toy train in circles, oblivious to the realities of transportation. In play, the models move for their own sake, not to move goods and people. Like Theodor Adorno put it in his essay “Toy Shop” (1951), the playing child shuns the calculating logic of industrial society. They look beyond the general abstraction into which things and people alike are subsumed. Instead of the world becoming a gray mass of exchange values, the playing child still sees color by appreciating an object for itself.


That children experience joy playing is a sign that they are not yet alienated. As a consequence, Adorno sees child’s play as a subversive activity. But is it the playing itself that subverts the logic of current societal arrangements, or is it a part of some wider notion of unalienated activity? And how does play even manifest within industrial society apart from the playing child?


Each in their own way, two 2023 films based on major toys help shed light on these issues: *Barbie* and *Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Honor Among Thieves*.


In *Barbie*, Margot Robbie embarks on a botched hero’s journey. As “stereotypical” Barbie, she parties every day in Barbie World with various other versions of Barbie and Ken. One day, weird things happen to her, from thinking about death to shunning high heels when she puts her feet flat on the ground. With a little push from an eccentric pseudo-punk reject, she enters the real world. There, Mattel executives come after her, and she and Ken (Ryan Gosling) learn more about societal structures of gender, to be applied back home.


The sets scream artifice in Barbie World, pink as they are. The environment feels as manufactured as director Greta Gerwigs performances from her mumblecore past feel genuine. Her spontaneity in films like *Nights and Weekends* or *Yeast* (2008) has been replaced by deliberate directing here. The film directly addresses the plastic sheen of its sets with coy winks, when for instance Ryan Gosling, desperate to impress as “beach” Ken, bumps head-on into the hard waves.


His overeager acting contributes to an overall sense of artifice. Especially Robbie’s uncanny facial expressions and impeccable appearance heightens it. The masses of Barbies and Kens explicitly act out different roles – no doubt conforming to Mattel’s product line. The film really drives home the point that its story deals with toys. Characters float down from heights, as if a child moves them around.


Gerwig’s scripting (with Noah Baumbach) sharply contrasts the pink Barbie World with a gray real world. In both almost every man turns out to be a doofus. It forms a set-up for rants about patriarchal values, riffing off the connotations of the Barbie doll with those values.


As Wolfgang M. Schmitt pointed out in his analysis, in this process the film foregoes any socio-economic dimension to the issues it moralizes about. Instead, it presents a “fixed” Barbie World at the end of Robbie’s journey. There, each person knows their place, from the president down to the builder. It feels like a utopia for dominance hierarchy enthusiasts.


With its self-awareness, the film myopically presents the Barbie doll as a conduit for myopic moral messaging. In this way, *Barbie* cynically sees the toy as a pedagogical tool only. Opposed to the self-contained activity of the child with model trains, play is seen here as a purely functional activity to train someone in exhibiting certain behavior. In that sense, it closely mirrors the instrumental logic that permeates industrial society.


Apart from Will Ferrell’s amusing antics as the bumbling Mattel CEO, *Barbie* dislikes fun. Its view of play as functional makes it into something dead serious, a far cry from historian Johan Huizinga’s definition. He argued that the basis for any culture lies in play – defined as non-seriousness. In his view, humans at heart are a playing animal: the “homo ludens”.


The *Dungeons &amp; Dragons* film embraces a vision of play closer to his. Directors Jonathan Goldstein and Francis Daley follow a ragtag group of misfits that stumble from one adventure to the next in a generic high fantasy world. The adventurer’s deeds often recall the mechanics of the tabletop role-playing game it is based on in various ways, recreating the average campaign as experienced by players and their dungeon master. 


As a simple example, characters introduce themselves with their class, like many at the table would do. In another hilarious instance, characters call attention to the peculiarities of the “speak with dead” spell. Undead answer their ill-posed questions a bit too faithfully, with a brain-dead logic reminiscent of Monty Python’s absurdities.


Most importantly though, highly stylized stunts show off classic monsters like owlbears, with the camera swirling around as characters shift to and fro in acrobatic ways. Michelle Rodriguez as a barbarian especially knows her way around the approaching henchmen, using whatever is at hand to battle them with. This extravagant blocking resembles the convoluted ways a player would describe their character in combat to a dungeon master.


The fantasy here comes across as subservient to enjoyment. Realism be damned. The visage of the city of Neverwinter appears without a farm in sight – features such as food provision aren’t addressed in Goldstein and Daley’s worldbuilding. When the group enters a dungeon, they get an explanation of how to traverse a bridge within it, only for one of them to immediately ignore all advice, step on the first tile, and destroy it. Instead of evoking a sense of history, the place rather feels like one elaborate set-piece, as if an interesting battle map to put miniatures on.


Through its self-aware humor, the film connects an idea of play as enjoyment to the product it is based on. It markets a game of Dungeons &amp; Dragons as escapist fun, through its attempt to capture the feel of sitting at the table with friends, and rolling some dice. Its view of play champions it as a time of leisure – as opposed to the time one spends laboring.


To this end, the fantasy world in *Dungeons &amp; Dragons* functions as a space to enable leisure. Goldstein and Daley’s sense of space reminds one of artist Constant Nieuwenhuys. With his conceptual city of New Babylon, he envisioned how human-constructed spaces should look like if everyone had swaths of free time, thanks to fully automated production of basic needs. One can see that urban planning as an extension of Huizinga’s notion of the homo ludens.


Instead of people tied to certain social arrangements, they would be able to move around and associate with others at will. In whatever space they may find themselves, they can construct or reconstruct that space without restrictions, encompassing all senses, including sound or smell. Being distributed in ever varying compositions across ever fluctuating spaces, people would realize their freedom through expressing their creativity.


Constant starts from a vision of play as creative expression, a far cry from the industrial vision of Barbie. Barbie World feels like the complete opposite of New Babylon. The hard plastic of the sets cannot in any way accommodate a state of flux. Its spaces scream in a monotone voice of pink, a reflection of how the toys within reproduce variations of the same societal arrangement with their fixed mannerisms. Regardless of which gender dominates, the characters stick to their roles within a rigid hierarchy.


The fantasy world of *Dungeons &amp; Dragons* feels more akin to Constants vision. Characters freely move around as if distance doesn’t matter, to embark on adventure after adventure, where monsters and traps challenge them to think creatively. Yet stylistically, the film, with its tongue in cheek joking and acrobatic camera movements, shows a problem with New Babylon.


For a place that stimulates creative expression, it feels too much like an amusement park – a place of hyper-individualist consumption.


Constants conceptual city hinges on a division in activity between labor and leisure. With the former mostly outsourced to advanced machinery, the latter is what occupies an individual’s time. As such, in planning that time it follows an instrumental logic inherent in technology as well, where the cost of producing has been minimized and the esteemed benefit of, in this case, free time, has been maximized. It bifurcates human activity in two rigid categories.


It reminds one of another one of Adorno’s essays, where he argues how within industrial society time for leisure merely serves as a time to recoup from the time spent laboring. The functional logic of labor comes to dominate leisure time as well. For instance, by scheduling those latter activities.


By adhering closely to the labor-leisure dichotomy, Constant implicitly follows that instrumental logic. Moreover, the creativity of New Babylon’s denizens can only be channeled through the use of the technologies of the city. Expression is mediated through a similar instrumental logic as a result, where the erected constructions are conceptualized from a form of a linear thinking of means and ends.


Those technologies have at the same time freed people from any obligations. In moving around without any ties however, Constants city merely reproduces the hyper-individualism running rampant in industrial society. Without any roots, the New Babylonian is a blank slate filled with expression filtered through technologies. Peculiarly, they feel like a contemporary consumer, who can pursue anything they want with a few clicks on their phone.


Yet both *Dungeons &amp; Dragons* and New Babylon do adhere to Huizinga’s notion of play as non-seriousness, as both ultimately champion joyful expression. Contrary to what Adorno’s essay suggests, play does not necessarily lead to subversion. Instead, play can be as alienated as any other activity within industrial society, engendered within its logic.


For an activity to potentially be subversive, it should arise organically from an individual. So what, if any, elements of the child’s play are responsible for its subversiveness? The actual game of Dungeons &amp; Dragons itself hints at an answer.


Played properly, the dungeon master describes challenging situations within a fantasy world for the players to respond to. They do this through their characters, stating their actions, which the dungeon master then resolves – if need be, with the help of the dice. From the outcome arises a new challenging situation, and the dynamic starts all over again.


Such a process done right stimulates one’s imaginative and problem-solving skills. Since players and their characters (or the dungeon master and the fantasy world) cannot be disentangled, these two capacities intertwine with social interaction. As a result, a story emerges from those interactions – and feeds back into them.


For instance, a party might after years still fondly recall how an angry giant blocked their way to a cursed temple of riches. Their characters being the misers they were, refused to pay him toll for passing through. Instead, they tricked him with playing on his love for mutton, cleverly deduced from conversation. Leading him to a trap, they could quickly escape, thanks to that one lucky roll they made at the end, as they held their breath in suspension.


Stories like these show how the game can fully engage the players. It arises organically from their own capacities. In that sense, Dungeons &amp; Dragons transforms the gaming table into a space of autonomy. It enables the expression of the full range of emotions a human being can hold.


It reveals the fundamental alienation present within industrial society. There, a disposition of calculation has taken precedence over the various other emotional dispositions that makes up an individual, instead of acknowledging it as one of the many.


*Barbie*, with its instrumental idea of play as pedagogy, clearly demonstrates that fundamental alienation. Producer Hasbro with its *Dungeons &amp; Dragons* film does not escape it either, as it sees play as a form of leisure opposed to labor, as passive entertainment. It does so, even as it is compatible with Huizinga’s notion of the homo ludens. It shows how even Constant’s New Babylon stays fully within the logic of industrial society as well, instead of subverting it.


Hence, play can become encapsulated within the overall disposition of calculation characteristic of industrial society. In the end, what’s so daring in Adorno’s playing child is the full engagement of its range of emotions within a self-created space of autonomy. Perhaps it is better to seek out unalienated activities in all its various forms, than it is to myopically put one’s hopes on the homo ludens alone.

Hey guys! I love doing projects like this just for fun. I love rating and ranking movies and doing brackets. It's a real sweet spot for me. I had this idea the other day so I figured I should pursue it. How this came to be was that I took a look at the most popular movies on Letterboxd, then I split them up into the 8 genres you see above. The seeds were simply determined by how high they were on Letterboxd's popularity list. There was a little bit of fudging with the genres just to make everything fit, but I don't believe there is anything egregiously out of place. For those who want to see all of the seeds broken down, here they are...

sound_of_freedom	movies	1jzb9wd	1744668016	April 11-13 Box Office Recap: On its second weekend, 'A Minecraft Movie' became the second biggest video game movie worldwide with $552 million. 'The King of Kings' over-performs projections, 'Warfare' opens decently, while 'The Amateur' and 'Drop' underwhelm.	"https://preview.redd.it/5wk8mzvkhvue1.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9ba860803c8b374c941afb76643bcd1250c8556d

Despite four wide releases this weekend, none of them could fight ***A Minecraft Movie*** for the top spot. ***The King of Kings*** delivered Angel Studios' second biggest debut, while stuff like ***The Amateur*** and ***Drop*** failed to light things up, although ***Warfare*** had a solid start.

The Top 10 earned a combined $145.1 million this weekend. That's up a colossal 112.4% from last year, when ***Civil War*** debuted with A24's biggest opener.

***A Minecraft Movie*** was still at #1, adding $78.5 million. That's a 52% drop; not as bad as some other video game films, but it's also quite rough for a family flick. For contrast, ***The Super Mario Bros. Movie*** dropped 36.9% on its second weekend. Through 10 days, the film has earned $278.8 million, and it's still on track to finish with over $450 million domestically.

In second place, Angel Studios' ***The King of Kings*** earned $19.2 million in 3,200 theaters. That's the studio's second biggest debut, behind ***Sound of Freedom*** ($19.6 million). It's also the biggest debut for an animated bible film, surpassing ***The Prince of Egypt*** ($14.5 million), although ***Prince*** sold more tickets adjusted for inflation.

This is promising, and Angel Studios did a fantastic job with marketing. Not to mention having the film open with Easter around the corner, which should help it leg out. Like their prior films, they used the ""Pay It Forward"" feature, wherein someone can pay for a ticket for anyone else. The numbers reported are only those that were redeemed this weekend.

According to Angel Studios, 59% of the audience was female. Despite middling critic reviews, the audience loved it more: they gave it a rare ""A+"" on CinemaScore, indicating strong word of mouth. The film should leg out all the way to $60 million at the very least, especially with no animated competition till June.

In third place, 20th Century Studios' ***The Amateur*** debuted with $14.8 million this weekend. This debut is lower than the recent action film ***A Working Man*** ($15.5 million), although that had a more bankable name in the lead role.

While it's tough to get better numbers, one still thinks that the film could've opened higher than this. After all, Disney and 20th Century mounted an extensive campaign for the film, hoping to replicate other action film successes. But the thing with ***The Amateur*** is that it simply didn't offer anything new in the genre: a man loses his wife and sets out to get revenge. That's a genre that has been copied so many times, and it's tough to get excited for the 37th time it's played out. Even reviews (62% on RT) aren't really glowing.

According to 20th Century Studios, 57% of the audience was male, and 47% was 25 and over. They gave it a so-so ""B+"" on CinemaScore, which doesn't exactly inspire confidence. With options like ***Sinners*** and ***The Accountant 2*** coming up, it'd be a surprise if ***The Amateur*** got close to $40 million lifetime.

In fourth place, A24's ***Warfare*** debuted with $8.3 million in 2,670 theaters. That's A24's sixth biggest debut, and while far off from Alex Garland's ***Civil War*** ($25.5 million), it wasn't ever going to come close to those numbers.

All in all, it's a solid start for the film. War films have been finding success in theaters, although films revolving around Iraq War have been quite inconsistent; some have succeeded (***American Sniper*** and ***The Hurt Locker***), others not so much (***Green Zone*** and ***Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk***). A24 did a great job in emphasizing the film's plot points: a real-time story of soldiers in Iraq. Some fantastic reviews (94% on RT) certainly helped as well.

According to A24, 72% of the audience was male, and 53% was 25 and over. They gave it a great ""A–"" on CinemaScore, which is A24's best grade (their only other film to get this grade was ***The Iron Claw***). This is very encouraging, and suggests the film could leg out. For now, a $25 million domestic total is likely for ***Warfare***.

In fifth place, Universal/Blumhouse's ***Drop*** earned just $7.3 million in 3,085 theaters. That's below other Blumhouse titles like ***The Woman in the Yard*** ($9.3 million) and ***Wolf Man*** ($10 million). These numbers are also below director Christopher Landon's ***Happy Death Day 2U*** ($9.8 million), which was considered a disappointment back in 2019.

Even though the film cost just $11 million, it feels like Universal simply didn't know what to do with the film. Even though they premiered it at SXSW, where it earned great reviews (83% on RT), it feels like they didn't push it hard enough. Or maybe the concept: a woman asked to kill her date to save her family didn't entice audiences. It's not unreasonable to believe that had the film come out during Blumhouse's golden years, it could've opened with $20 million or more. Are audiences giving up on Blumhouse? 

According to Universal, 53% of the audience was female and 35% was in the 25-34 demographic. They gave it a middling ""B"" on CinemaScore; this is not bad, but it's not great either. With some competition on the way, it's unlikely it save some face. It'd be a surprise if the film came anywhere close to $25 million lifetime.

***The Chosen: Last Supper — Part 3*** earned $6 million this weekend. That's a 14% drop from ***Part 2*** ($6.9 million) last week. Across these 3 films, they have amassed $36.3 million domestically.

***A Working Man*** was hit hard by the newcomers. It dropped a steep 59%, adding $3 million this weekend. The film has earned $33.4 million so far, and it looks like it will struggle to hit $40 million domestically.

Disney's ***Snow White*** continues its freefall. The film now dropped 51%, adding just $2.8 million this weekend. Clearly, this film simply has no legs. The film has earned just $82 million so far, and it's guaranteed to finish below $90 million domestically. Terrible all around.

Ninth place belonged to Blumhouse's ***The Woman in the Yard***, which fell 54% and added $2 million this weekend. The film has earned $20.3 million so far, and it's finishing with something close to $25 million.

Rounding up the Top 10 was ***The Chosen: Last Supper — Part 2***. The film collapsed 86% this weekend, earning $961,861 this weekend. Through 10 days, it has earned $10.9 million so far.

#**OVERSEAS**

***A Minecraft Movie*** was still the #1 movie overseas. It added $79.6 million, taking its worldwide total to a colossal $552 million after just 2 weekends. The best markets are the UK ($39.8M), China ($20.3M), Germany ($18.9M), Mexico ($18.7M) and Australia ($18.5M). With this, it has already passed the ***Sonic*** movies to become the second biggest video game movie ever. The billion milestone is becoming more and more likely.

***The Amateur*** slightly over-performed projections overseas, earning $17.2 million for a $32.2 million worldwide debut. The best debuts were in France ($1.6M), the UK ($1.4M), Mexico ($1.4M), Germany ($1.1M) and Japan ($1.1M). Based on the pattern of other action films, the film should hit the $100 million milestone, although some rough competition will put a challenge to that.

***Snow White*** is nearing the end of its run worldwide. The film added just $4.7 million overseas, for a terrible $182.3 million worldwide total. Based on its drops, it looks like the film might go under $200 million worldwide. On a $270 million budget. Ouch.

#**FILMS THAT ENDED THEIR RUN THIS WEEK**

Movie | Release Date | Studio | Domestic Opening | Domestic Total | Worldwide Total | Budget |
----------|----------|----------|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:
*Moana 2* | Nov/27 | Disney | $139,787,385 | $460,405,297 | $1,059,197,729 | $150M
*Novocaine* | Mar/14 | Paramount | $8,809,436 | $19,861,854 | $33,545,800 | $18M

- ***Moana 2*** has closed with $1.059 billion worldwide. Considering it was heading straight to streaming, that's a huge win for Disney Animation. Even if the quality of the film suffered as a result. The film debuted with a gigantic $389 million worldwide, which was the biggest debut for an animated title. But the film proved to be a bit front-loaded, especially for an animated film. A third film is inevitable, but Disney should really begin development as a film, not a half-assed TV show changed to a film.

- No pain, no gain. Paramount's ***Novocaine*** closed with just $33 million worldwide, failing to recoup its $18 million budget. That's eerily close the numbers earned by Jack Quaid's previous film, ***Companion***. Despite hitting #1 on its opening weekend, the film simply couldn't find an audience in the weeks afterwards. Quaid may be popular online, but that doesn't mean people are paying to watch him lead a movie.

#**THIS WEEKEND**

One film will try to challenge ***Minecraft*** for the top spot.

That film is Ryan Coogler's ***Sinners***, which stars Michael B. Jordan in a dual role in this horror title. Warner Bros. has backed up the film with an extensive marketing campaign, granting Coogler with his terms: the film's rights will revert back to him in 25 years. Coogler has had massive success with the ***Creed*** and ***Black Panther*** films, but this is his first major original film. And early reviews suggest he really cooked: it's sitting at a fantastic 100% on RT with 45 reviews so far. The big question is: will audiences support this?

Personally, I love how, in the beginning of the film, we see from Strauss’s perspective that Einstein is standing near a pond &amp; his hat flew off and fell down, which Oppie picked up and handed it to him. 

They discussed something that was kept hidden until the very end, where it was revealed, they talked about the chain reaction &amp; how it had begun, but in another context. 

Was that real?
Because I got goosebumps. 
I love that in almost all Nolan movie, you figure out the motivation or meaning behind all the story in the last scene, where the entire film comes together.

Cinematically it looks phenomenal. New York in the 1960’s, the Nazi train in the 1940’s and even the 214BBC sequence just looks phenomenal.

You could tell this film was shot on location with practical effects like a real Indy movie should be.

Ford gave honestly his single greatest performance as the character in this one. He had me tearing up on more than one occasion. This was a passion project for him and it showed. 

Another banger by John Williams as well. 

Absolutely loved this film and what a great sendoff for one of cinemas all time great characters.

Approx 2010s	"Scrolling through TikTok and came across a clip from a movie but couldn't find anything to identify the film, it's really bugging me so I am hoping someone can help. There's a kid called Joey who tells a girl neighbour he is going to marry her which she finds creepy and tells him to stay away from her. Later we find them hanging out in a shed or outhouse where they are getting to know one another and he asks her if praying really works. She replies I hope so before asking what happened to his eye. He tells her that his sister threw a Barbie doll at him but it doesn't hurt. Jump to sometime later and he finds out he is being moved on from his foster home having been suspended from school for fighting and expelled. The girl hands him a scarf as a farewell gift and apologises about the colour to which he reponds that he likes the colour and that she should wait for him as he will find her, like he said, he wants to marry her.

oppenheimer	movies	1hjx8t6	1734869161	you guys ever noticed that there are actually two water-rippling sequence in oppenheimer?	"if you rewatch the film, you'd notice another scene with the ripples at the end of the movie, when he talks with einstein. both scenes tells different stories:

1. the ripple sequence in the beginning tells how oppenheimer is curious and intrigued by ""a different universe""-a different perspective of the quantum world and how he goes on, driven by curiosity.

https://preview.redd.it/tr1h0e3k4e8e1.png?width=225&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=72854e44d7b8b98f9b4f7e0016b5aaa201c91c90

2. after the bombing, he becomes devastated by the impact his invention had on the world. so the 2nd sequence which comes at the end depicts the catastrophic consequences of his own creation, tells us how he imagines that he had done 'a chain reaction' and he got 'blood on his hands'.

the ripples also evoke a sense of universal interconnectedness, echoing oppenheimer’s own view of science, life, and morality. They suggest how small actions in one domain (e.g. theoretical physics) can have cosmic, even existential, consequences.

indiana_jones	movies	1m45scg	1752955860	Today's equivalent of Indiana Jones movies ?	"Just re-re-re-re-watched Raiders of the Lost Ark and… yeah, it still absolutely slaps.  
That perfect mix of action, mystery, history, adventure, humor — they just don’t make them like that anymore.

I’m on the hunt for movies with a similar vibe — that globe-trotting, puzzle-solving, ancient-secret-uncovering kind of energy. Stuff with hidden temples, booby traps, lost relics, cryptic clues…

So far I’ve enjoyed:  
\- National Treasure (especially the first one)  
\- Da Vinci Code and the rest (including the Lost Symbol serie)  
\- Uncharted (fun, but felt more like watching a cutscene compilation...)

But I know I’ve barely scratched the surface.

oppenheimer	TrueFilm	15ozx7i	1691832116	Thoughts about the Oppenheimer Screenplay and its Sorkin Approach	"My Take is that the Sorkin Approach Works very well in the Biofilm in which a titular character has underlying complexities to it, so a parallel two three side tracks which add on to that main character works well. I am sure a straight track might function just as good but parallel tracks to me feel like the movie is trying to embody the different nature and characteristics of the titular character (here Oppenheimer), It's not easy to embody the same thing in a straight track because of sensitivity regarding the possible disconnect, the screenplay needs to be tweaked ever so slightly without getting it overdone 

The cuts were done very well and reminiscent of the social network; however, I felt the transition between the parallel tracks was NOT in perfect sync, especially in the first half. The second half was a lot better in handling the transitions. Once again, I want to articulate how the Sorkin approach to storytelling helped immensely here as It kind of gives the movie kind of rush feeling where the cuts are complemented by the dialogue, and scenes just keeps building on the last one 

The Characters  for me was largely well written, especially the few people of the manhattan project, Oppenheimer in himself as well as her wife, Nolan, didn't shy away from showing the vulnerability of Oppenheimer; however, we only see that with regards to how he handles his personal life

Lastly, it might be nitpicking for me; however, Nolan gets carried away in the second half with scenes consisting of dialogues a little bit more than required as he was hinging on that to maintain pace. I do feel. However, the actors did really well in selling out the tension, particularly Jason Clark and Robert Drowney Jr. Furthermore I would also say the movie isnt very subtle and doesn't give much time to reflect which could have been a dealbreaker but it worked out so well here like social network   


I also would love to hear about your favorite biopic of yours which essentially didn't have a very sorkin touch but stood out to be a great film."	/r/TrueFilm/comments/15ozx7i/thoughts_about_the_oppenheimer_screenplay_and_its/	https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/15ozx7i/thoughts_about_the_oppenheimer_screenplay_and_its/

It got me thinking about more future stories to tell involving the professor, and how it doesn’t have to be Harrison Ford portraying him.

I went down a rabbit hole of having different iterations of the Archeologist every decade and a half or so just like the Bond franchise.

It would be cool to have a more suave lead or a more emotionally driven lead. It would also be refreshing for the character not to be tied down with cannon that has happened in the films thus far or what’s alluded to in between them.

oppenheimer	TrueFilm	159fog5	1690307576	No one will remember Oppenheimer and Christopher Nolan is only highly regarded for his old glorious days	"I love Nolan's movies and I have watched many of them more than twice. He has my utter respect, even after what seems to be a decline in his career. But I can't stand in silence anymore. That's it, there I've said it. 2017 Dunkirk, 2020 Tenet and now, 2023 Oppenheimer. His last 3 movies are, despite the grand praises of obvious fans, are sub-par at best. You can see how Dunkirk and Tenet failed to withstand the test of time. Nobody cares about those movies anymore and they are irrelevant already. Because Nolan stopped telling us about humanity and creating actual art, after Interstellar. It was Nolan's last true masterpiece and he should have stopped right there and be a flawless legend. Now he is a flawed legend, a unrefutable legend but with some mistakes a legend shouldn't have made.

Now I am sure there are thousands of people willing and a thousand different arguments to defend Christopher Nolan's recent work. But I know what will happen in the face of undeludable test of time. People will not regard Oppenheimer as a significant movie just because it created some marketing ripples back in 2023.

Nolan had his time, now he is simply spending from his reputational savings, so to say.

His stories tells us nothing about human nature. He is not putting on an aesthetic piece of work, he is not utilizing the IMAX technology which after seeing Oppenheimer I now firmly believe he only uses for marketing reasons. His storytelling techniques are based on smoke-and-mirrors tricks without substance, his characters empty as they can be. When did you last invest in a Nolan character? Have you cared about any of the boy band hotties in Dunkirk? Or the expressionless hero of Tenet? What Oppenheimer tells us about himself besides doing small tricks of light reflecting off Cillian Murphy's baby blues? What did even the all-star cast, a giant armada of world-class stars contribute to the movie besides standing as marketing ploys? It's painful to see Nolan create such unpolished, rookie work. And it's worse when you realize his actions might have bad intention behind. 

At this point there are 3 possibilities as far as I can imagine. Old man either only seeks money to fill up the grandchildrens' savings account or he is just inept to create a compelling and an important, thought and emotion evoking movie. Or, he is just fucking with everyone to see how hard the critics can lick his boots to stay relevant.

Only problem is, Nolan should step off the stage or create some real art with real passion. Old masters  of art should not disgrace themselves by lowering their standarts in time, they should know when to leave the table, sit back and watch where the young men of tomorrow are taking the world as he supports them with his connections and vast knowledge."	/r/TrueFilm/comments/159fog5/no_one_will_remember_oppenheimer_and_christopher/	https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/159fog5/no_one_will_remember_oppenheimer_and_christopher/	
oppenheimer	TrueFilm	1ah6135	1706886940	I just rewatched Oppenheimer and was punched in the face by its mediocrity.	"I liked it the first time, but this time it exuded such emptiness, induced such boredom. I saw it in a theater both times by the way. It purely served as a visual (and auditory) spectacle.

The writing was filled with corny one-liners and truisms, the performances were decent but nothing special. Murphy's was good (I liked Affleck's as well), but his character, for someone who is there the whole 3 hours, is neither particularly compelling nor fleshed out. The movie worships his genius while telling us how flawed he is but does little to demonstrate how these qualities actually coexist within the character. He's a prototype. It would have been nice to sit with him at points, see what he's like, though that would have gone against the nature of the film and Nolen's style.

I just don't think this approach is well-advised, its grandiosity, which especially on rewatch makes everything come across as superfluous and dramatic about itself. The set of events portrayed addresses big questions, but it is difficult to focus on these when their presentation is heavy-handed and so much of the film is just bland.

I'm curious to see what you think I've missed or how I'm wrong because I myself am surprised about how much this movie dulled on me the second around."	/r/TrueFilm/comments/1ah6135/i_just_rewatched_oppenheimer_and_was_punched_in/	https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/1ah6135/i_just_rewatched_oppenheimer_and_was_punched_in/

This is peak Indiana Jones. The pacing, tone, action, mystery—it’s perfect. Everything feels grounded, the Ark is an incredible artifact, and there’s this raw energy to the movie that none of the others ever fully captured. It’s the blueprint for what an adventure movie should be.

# 2. The Last Crusade

A really close second. The father-son dynamic adds a lot, and Sean Connery absolutely kills it—probably the best casting choice in the series outside of Harrison himself. Their chemistry is perfect, and it gives the movie a more emotional core than the others.

The locations are top-tier—Venice, the castle in Austria, the desert tank battle. Everything feels big, but still grounded in history and myth. The grail trials at the end are some of the most memorable sequences in the entire franchise. You get puzzles, traps, ancient relics—classic Indy stuff.

It leans more into humor than *Raiders*, but it doesn’t lose the heart or the sense of adventure. And it does a great job balancing action with story, without ever dragging. Honestly, if *Raiders* didn’t exist, this would easily be the best Indy film. It’s just endlessly rewatchable.

# 3. Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

I know this is super controversial, but I actually really like this one. It’s over-hated. The action is constant—warehouse escape, bike chase, jungle fight, ant swarm, temple collapse—it *feels* like Indy. The pacing moves, there’s archaeology and mystery again, and it sounds and looks like an Indiana Jones film.

People always bring up the aliens and the fridge scene like that’s enough to disqualify it, but let’s be real—this is a franchise that had a dude get his heart ripped out and survive, literal face-melting from the Ark, and a 700-year-old knight guarding the Holy Grail. Supernatural weirdness has always been baked into this series.

I also think a big part of the hate came from Gen X fans who were still bitter about the Star Wars prequels. A lot of people just wanted to dog on anything George Lucas touched at that point, but that's not for me to ramble on about. And honestly, outside of the fridge and the aliens (which aren't even *that* wild by Indy standards), I haven’t heard many real criticisms of the movie.

It sounds like an Indy film, acts like one, and Harrison isn’t so old that it feels off. Unlike *Dial of Destiny*, he still looks and moves believably in the action scenes. He’s sharp, delivers his lines well. Is it goofy? Yeah. This one’s way more fun and rewatchable than people give it credit for.

# 4. Temple of Doom

Personally, I’ve always felt the pacing in *Temple of Doom* was way off—and I know I’m not alone on that. A lot of critics and longtime fans have pointed out the same thing. The movie kicks off with some of the best action in the whole series: the Club Obi-Wan escape, the plane ejection, and the raft drop. It’s nonstop for the first 20 minutes, and honestly, it had me thinking I was in for something just as fun and fast-paced as *Raiders*.

But then they get to **Pankot Palace**, and the movie just… stalls. There’s this weird, bloated stretch where nothing really happens—awkward dinner scenes, slow dialogue, vague tension—and it feels like all the momentum from the beginning is gone. Once they go underground into the **Temple of Kali**, the whole tone shifts into something super bleak.

From there, it’s just dark tunnels, child slavery, brainwashing, and black magic rituals for what feels like forever. There’s barely any sense of discovery or adventure—it’s just suffering and cult horror. And yeah, the mine cart chase and the rope bridge fight are incredible, but by then, you’ve been stuck in this gloomy middle section for so long that it kind of drags the whole experience down.

That pacing drop isn’t just something I picked up on—critics at the time mentioned it too. Even Spielberg later admitted this was his least favorite of the series. I get that it has its fans, and I still love parts of it, but it just doesn’t feel like *classic* Indy to me. *The Last Crusade* really felt like they took the feedback and course-corrected everything.

# 5. Dial of Destiny

This one’s not even in my head canon. Sloppy, lazy, and soulless. The writing felt phoned in, the characters felt hollow, and the movie had no real reason to exist. That de-aging in the opening? Looked like a PS3 cutscene—just flat and uncanny.

They pushed the believability too far. Harrison’s pushing 80 and they’ve got him riding in a tuk-tuk, dodging bullets, and doing chase scenes that feel completely unbelievable. He’s barely even the focus of the story. The whole movie just felt like a weird cash grab made out of obligation instead of passion.

The only part that felt remotely like Indy was the first 20 minutes. If they had used proper deepfake tech (like they did for Luke in *Book of Boba Fett*), had Harrison provide the voice (with a tuner like they did for James Earl Jones), and used a solid stand-in for action—**they could’ve actually made something good.** But instead, we got a film that not only ends the franchise on a low note, but kind of disrespects the legacy of the character.

indiana_jones	movies	1bbhag2	1710095487	The opening scene in Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom is the pinnacle of fun action/adventure filmmaking	"One of the things that make action/adventure films fun is the escalation of danger around every turn - what can go wrong, should go wrong. Spielberg absolutely mastered this.

The scene starts as a straightforward exchange - a relic for a diamond. Of course there's a double cross (even this is stylish, as instead of just handing over the diamond, it's spun around on a lazy susan). 

A gun is drawn, Lao has the upper hand. Indy grabs his girl, now he has the upper hand. But Indy drank poison, now Lao has the upper hand again. 

Once the diamond and antidote go skittering across the dance floor, all hell breaks loose as people kick both items every which way, all while Jones and the woman try to recover them on their hands and knees. Every time they're close, they get further away. The most fun aspect of this is certainly when the bucket of ice tips over on the diamond...chef's kiss. Balloons, a giant gong, a flaming kebob, a tommy gun, it's all really fun with great moments of comedy sprinkled throughout.

Yet even once they're out, they're not really out. A short car chase leads to an airplane, where Indy thinks he's safe until we see the name on the outside of the plane. Then it turns into our heroes having to jump out of a plane on a raft into the snow, which transitions into an implausible white-water rafting trip.

It's an excellent start to the film and sets the tone perfectly for what you're about to see."	/r/movies/comments/1bbhag2/the_opening_scene_in_indiana_jones_and_the_temple/	https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1bbhag2/the_opening_scene_in_indiana_jones_and_the_temple/

barbie	movies	18u3cea	1703899739	The odd, specifically NOT queer, anti-revolutionary chauvinism of Barbie (2023)	"I think it's funny, but also sad that the movie puts the characters in the role not of revolutionaries, but counter-revolutionaries.

The goals and quest of the Heroes of Barbie is very strange.

In the movie, it's made clear the Kens are oppressed. Let's be clear. The movie doesn't pretend this isn't the case. All the jobs are held by Barbies. All the positions of political power are held by Barbies. The kens are literally all homeless. 

Into this unjust situation, arrives the heroes of our story. They're not organizing and uniting to destroy an patriarchal ruling class systems. They're conspiring to put down a revolution by an admittedly oppressed class that has been historically excluded from power by turning members of the revolution against each other. 

Which is just FUCKING WILD.

It really says a LOT who made this film, and what they want you to take away from it. Anyone familiar with the history of revolutionary movements knows this is EXACTLY the same playbook used against them, including against women's rights movements.

Ignore and dismiss them until they pose a threat. Infiltrate their ranks. Turn them against each other. Seize power. Restore the status quo.

In the movie they don't resolve the total lack of men having access to housing, political office, or jobs, the problems that caused the revolution. Once the Barbies seize power, of instituting a state of gender parity, they instead kick all the Kens out of their homes and offices and reinstate supremacy. Promising to one day deliver some kind of possible parity.

Normally, movies and stories that include a revolutionary movement work on a kind of Hegalian Dialectics. The Hero putting forward a Thesis, the villian putting forward a flawed, but understandable Anthesis, and the story ending in a Synthisis combing the best ideas of both. In this case, you'd expect the Barbie's to share power and resolve these issues. But it doesn't.

Feminism has always been about the tearing down of patriarchy, a system of oppression that oppresses men and women via imposed gender roles, but especially oppresses women. It's not called feminism purely because of women's liberation components, but because of it's antithetical opposition to patriarchy. It is, at it's core, a revolutionary movement opposing supremacy.

The Barbie film isn't interested in that. In the film, Barbies rule over Kens with absolute power. They are the benevolent rulers. While they acknowledge the Ken's have issues, it is not their place to try and seize power to resolve them. And the Barbies are under no obligation to share power. The supremacist status quo at the start of the movie is how the movie ends. There will be no compromises. There will be no change. The film presents a thesis, an anthesis, and throws the obvious synthesis straight in the garbage doubling down on the hero's thesis. 

It should be no surprise to anyone how a movie about a famous doll brand is very much antirevolutionary. How it portrays the CEO of the company producing those dolls as a loveable man who just wants to make little girls happy. How a movie made by and staring the wealthy doesn't see revolution as a good thing, but a bad thing that must be stopped. 

Some may be disappointed in the fact that this film does not at all the fact that little boys DO play with Barbies. Be disappointed about how this film doesn't at all wonder where queer barbies or kens play in the world of Barbieland. It's lots of queer little girls playing with Barbies absolutely paired Barbie off with another Barbie. If the movie is an physical manifestation of how imaginary play, where is all that? Why does none of that exist?

Because that's not what Barbieland or Barbie (the movie) ultimately is about. It's not about feminisms either. It is about the fantasy of female supremacism. About the idea that woman should run the world, and if they did, everything would be better.

It's about the idea that the antithesis to male supremacy isn't equality, but female supremacy. That the solution to the problems imposed by patriarchy is matriarchy.  

It's exactly the simplistic, oppressive worldview that leaves no room for people who fall outside of the dichotomy. There are no queer people in Barbie. There are no little boys who play with girls toys in Barbie. They do not exist because their existence is one the ideology of the film cannot account for, so outright ignores. Where the roles of oppressed and oppressors are not eliminated, but simply reversed.

Male chauvinism is rooted in the the idea of chauvinism. Chauvinism being the idea that the group you belong it is the best, and is deserving of all power and supremacy. Anyone can be a chauvinist. Anyone can believe that the group they identify with whether it be their nation, their race, their gender is what makes them better. 

The tragic thing about Barbie is that's what so many people will walk away from Barbie not questioning. Barbie reframes feminism as not a movement to break down unjust systems of power, but simply one to impose it's own. That to be a feminist is not to oppose chauvinism, but to simply be a different kind of chauvinist."	/r/movies/comments/18u3cea/the_odd_specifically_not_queer_antirevolutionary/	https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/18u3cea/the_odd_specifically_not_queer_antirevolutionary/

Usually I leave them to it as this is ""their thing"". However, it has occurred to me recently all the classic films from the 80s, 90s and 2000s they watch together are pretty male centred. Think star wars, Indiana jones type things. All great films! But not the only things out there. So we have started watching some things together that are a bit more women  centred. So far she has really enjoyed oceans 8, miss congeniality, the devil wears prada and practical magic. Any suggestions for some others to include on the list?

barbie	movies	18xkcxf	1704291266	barbie: a movie that i like...but don't love.	"so, i just watched the barbie movie, often considered to be the one of the best movies of 2023. as you can imagine, my expectations were pretty high. well, my final assessment is that i like it but i don't love it. it's not one of my favorite movies of the past year but it is still a solid movie.

let's start with some things i enjoyed. firstly, the movie is extremely funny. the film had quite a few jokes that had me on the ground laughing. the film was also quite well acted with many solid performances. the film also got extremely ambitious with it's filmmaking. you wouldn't think that the fucking barbie movie would have ambitious filmmaking in it but this film had unique scene transitions that were quite impressive. the film also had amazing set design, some of the best i've ever seen. the barbieland set might be one of my favorite movie sets of all time. not to mention, the film has great themes of equality and female empowerment. and considering the recent overturning of roe v wade, a movie about female empowerment could not have come at a more relevant time.

however, there were a few things that held the movie back for me. for starters, despite being quite funny, there were a few jokes that didn't land for me. the whole ""hi barbie, hi ken"" thing from the beginning got old really fucking quickly. we get it! they're all named barbie and ken! also, the film constantly felt the need to shoehorn jokes into every single scene. with the exception of the excellent penultimate scene, every scene that seemed like it should be purely dramatic had extremely out of place moment of humor in it. i get that the movie is a comedy but even comedic movies know when to let a dramatic moment be a dramatic moment. little miss sunshine does this beautifully. the film is a comedy first and for most but it also has several dramatic moments that work. and part of the reason for this, aside from the excellent writing and acting, is that the filmmakers took the dramatic moments seriously. i was hoping that barbie would have that balance. and what makes this even more frustrating is that the penultimate scene does strike this balance, showing that the filmmakers were capable of having purely dramatic moments but just opted not to.

so yeah, barbie is overall a very good movie but not the near flawless masterpiece the movie going public seems to think it is. the film is an entertaining movie that is both funny and though provoking. it's a film that tells us that we've come a long way but still have a long way to go. it's a film that encourages equality of the sexes and tells us about our current society. and it does all this while also managing to be entertaining and funny. nevertheless, like most movies, the film does have flaws that are kind of difficult to ignore."	/r/movies/comments/18xkcxf/barbie_a_movie_that_i_likebut_dont_love/	https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/18xkcxf/barbie_a_movie_that_i_likebut_dont_love/

oppenheimer	TrueFilm	1j26ke7	1740963471	Oppenheimer's Ending Goes to Emotional and Gets It Wrong	"Just watched Oppenheimer for the first time last night as apart of the IMAX re-release and I found profoundly overrated. I have the same gripes about the movie as a lot of other people have said here but I want to specifically talk about the ending.

In the end Nolan tries to pull on the heartstrings of the audience and makes it wayyyy weighty where most people leave the feeling with a feeling of dread and the inevitability of the demise of the human race. This is close to what should be the actual takeaway but the nuance is the beauty and it loses that entirely.

Earlier in the film Oppy comes to Einstein to ask his opinion about the calculations that they had run that said it was likely that a nuclear bomb detonating would start a chain reaction that would never stop and destroy the entire universe. They later revised those calculations and believed it to be ""near 0"" but the risk of a near 0 chance of ending the world was worth it to build the bomb to get it before the Germans and end the war.

Now back to the end, Oppy tells Einstein that we're now in a world where we have a near 0 chance of ending the world but not from nuclear chain reaction, but from a nuclear escalation chain reaction. 

It's a devil's bargain that after the creation of the bomb it ushered into the world the most peaceful time in human history, where a full scale hot war between great powers does not happen. However, there is a ""near 0"" chance that MAD doesn't work and wires get crossed and we all die. 

THAT tradeoff of ""Would you accept the elimination of global wars for a near 0 chance of ending the world?"" is much more interesting than the forced takeaway of ""Nuclear bomb bad, destruction of human kind imminent."""	/r/TrueFilm/comments/1j26ke7/oppenheimers_ending_goes_to_emotional_and_gets_it/	https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/1j26ke7/oppenheimers_ending_goes_to_emotional_and_gets_it/

barbie	TrueFilm	191heqf	1704706407	I know I'm late to the topic, but Barbie was really bad	"I just saw the movie yesterday and would like to comment, but my post got removed from r/movies, which is a shame because although it got a lot of upset replies at least it was interesting to see how strongly people disagreed. But I wish there was more debate, so maybe this sub is a better fit I hope. 

I'm sure most subreddits have been oversaturated with the topic since the movie came out but most of the discussions about the movie are either criticisms of it as a ""feminist movie"" or love for it for pretty much the same reason. I have some other comments to make, I am sure they are also not original but I at least don""t see them mentioned so much. My first post was super long, this time I'll just make a few key points and then can discuss it more in the comments (it will still be long but no one's forced to read).

My issues with the movie:

1. The actual story - this movie gives itself no space to develop its themes after the original premise/setup. Barbie spends hardly any time in the real world aside from a few fast-paced moments, the last one being a really uninteresting Mattel chase. So there is no real exploration of ideas. The movie constantly changes scenery and goes from one urgency to another, and then communicates the ideas by just having characters explain them either through narration or monologues.

2. The metaphores are muddled - no, I didn't find the movie confusing but because it wants to touch on so many topics and has to do it so superficially, sometimes the same thing is used as a vessel for several purposes and just feels weak

3. A lot of pointless or underdeveloped characters who just took screentime without adding anything. Which is almost ridiculous since I am sure a tween girl can be a foil for some interesting commentary on Barbie but instead wasn't really anything. Not to mention the whole Mattel team, or ""Ruth"".

4. Too many themes introduced and barely touched upon, or done so in a way that isn't reinforced by the story. For example, Barbie had thoughts about death and existential crisis, and in the end she chooses to be a real woman. But death and aging is limited to one scene in the movie where she sees an old lady and calls her beautiful, and she barely spends time in real world, and the thoughts actually come from the human woman whose life is just as unexplored (it seems her biggest oppressor is her daughter tbh)

5. The monologue/messages not always fitting the context - I realize people like this monologue a lot but it was so underwhelming for me, all the complaints were very generic, or don't even make that much sense but are vague enough to interpret them in any way you see fit. Contrast that for instance with the cool girl monologue from Gone Girl, which of course isn't exactly the same topic, but I believe there are more overlaps than it seems on the surface. The latter is specific, resonates, is even insightful about how this shit works, puts something concrete to words. The former is just a list of vague alleged social expectations that doesn't even successfully point any contradictions it tries to show. But to take it a step further, the speech was delivered to Barbies after their one day under Ken's patriarchy. Barbies who lived in a totally different world than human women, and whose patriarchy exercie was not only short but also very shallow as clearly they didn't grow up with it affecting their development (as additionally shown in the fact they were not immune to it taking over) - so why would her speech, even if super accurate, resonate with them at all?

6. The key message comes down to is that Barbies represent a flawed but well meaning girl power feminism, and the movie tells you that women don't have to be perfect, perfectly ambitious etc, it's ok to be flawed, basically that ""feminism is all about choice and all choices are valid, and you don't have to be great."" Which is incredibly banal. It is also incredibly cliche that has been a thing for decades. this is hardly some fresh discussion point. And ok, having a banal feelgood message for a non ambitious comedy is fine but a) it isn't treated this way by the audiences, people consider it very clever and b) the light comedy is a messy convoluted story.

I must also add that it's pretty clever from a marketing pov how Barbies came to represent flawed girl power feminism, when in reality the criticisms of barbie were that it's very anti-feminist, but ok I don't expect a Mattel movie to really touch this. So like, Barbie will get criticized, but let's make up what it gets criticized for. Ok. This is just an observation and didn't affect my view of the movie.

I could go on but I'll stop here and we can talk more in the comments. I also like how the viewers go from ""how can you have any expectations from a movie about a doll"" to ""the topics are intelligent and relevant and really moved me"" (I get it's not the same people but still.) I am rating this movie based on how interesting and enjoyable it was for me, that's all.

I think Ken's arc was definitely the strongest, the most coherent, and the one that had some funny moments. He was also acted very well. I wasn't a fan of the musical bit but I can understand why it works for a lot of viewers. On a super basic expectations level I can identify who Ken starts as, what his struggles are, why he makes the choices he does and how he develops through the plot, and that arc has humor in it and is very decent. Can't say that for the rest of the movie."	/r/TrueFilm/comments/191heqf/i_know_im_late_to_the_topic_but_barbie_was_really/	https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/191heqf/i_know_im_late_to_the_topic_but_barbie_was_really/	
indiana_jones	movies	1dp4e1m	1719423052	Why the Indiana Jones franchise fizzled out - Discussion	"Alright hear me out. I love Indiana Jones. one of the greatest characters in all of fiction media! Which is why it's so sad to see such a great character franchise ruined.. but what happened? I will explain:



The first 3 Indiana Jones films were phenomenal, each in their own way. but what made them so successful? well, pretty much everything. The characters, the writing, the directing, the music, the actors' portrayals, and the story lines themselves.



They kept you locked into your seat and you couldn't wait to see more and after it was all said and done, you were satisfied and had a big smile on your face. and at the end of Last Crusade,, they literally rode off into the sunset. All would have been fine there, a fitting end to a solid trilogy. BUT THEN...



Producers couldn't leave well enough alone. They made another movie, the 4th one: Kingdom of th Crystal skull.



Now, to be fair, it wasnt a TERRIBLE movie, but it was not the same. it was not on the same level as the other films. Most people were not happy with it. Why not?? It still had the same formula, right??



The familiar characters, the same director, same music, same excitement and adventure. But something was still ""off"". Well my friends... here it is: They changed the Genre!



While they're all comfortably sitting in the ""Adventure"" category, there was more to it than that.

  
The original 3 films were SUPERNATURAL, dealing with mystical powers, beyond human understanding, relating to spirituality, faith, and religion.

  
The final 2 films (Kingdom &amp; Dial of Destiny) were SCIENCE FICTION. One focusing on Aliens, the other focusing on Time Travel.



THIS is where things deviated. And while both films were entertaining in their own right, they just missed the mark. They replaced a key ingredient with a new flavor and it just didnt work as well as we'd hoped.

  
If they'd stuck with the original recipe (or left it alone for that matter) maybe things would have turned out better.

  
Anyway, that's my rant. Comments welcome!"	/r/movies/comments/1dp4e1m/why_the_indiana_jones_franchise_fizzled_out/	https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1dp4e1m/why_the_indiana_jones_franchise_fizzled_out/	
oppenheimer	movies	1dlon9b	1719035135	Must-watch movie suggestions?	"I never got into movies growing up, but I recently watched a few and have been enjoying them!

Would love some movie suggestions

Liked : Everything Everywhere All at once
Hated  : Oppenheimer, Encanto (any musical lol), lots of other movies

I loved Everything Everywhere all at once 2022, here’s what I loved to help u guys give me suggestions:

-the attention to detail in the shots: the way shots are framed, the snappy edits and cuts (double entendres were fun also); it really made me feel immersed in the movie in a way I never was before

-genre mixing involving comedy is right up my ally

-how good the acting, u can tell by just the facial expressions what’s going on. 

-characters made a lot of sense + liked the character development: the way that a select few characters just get repeated throughout the film is great they get incorporated in a way that they aren’t the whole movie but u still get the opportunity to learn passively about them in a way that drives the story forward as the movie progresses

-unexpected ends and plot twists

-generally cohesive story, without bits dragging on for too long or unneeded plot points / pointless repetition.

#TLDR; the most important things that I love to watch in other films are : 
#-Good + thoughtful camera shots, and relatively fast paced editing
#-Genre mixing with comedy
#-characters that actually move the plot forward
#-unexpected ends and plot twists
#-nice pace, without bits dragging on for too long 


I tried watching Oppenheimer alone and stopped at the first 8 minutes because I got bored. I might revisit it soon if I have to watch it with a friend."	/r/movies/comments/1dlon9b/mustwatch_movie_suggestions/	https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1dlon9b/mustwatch_movie_suggestions/

Day 37: Maryland winner was The Blair Witch Project. It came from behind to beat Wedding Crashers. As a kid growing up next to woods, The Blair Witch Project scared the hell outta me as a kid! Just that whole premise of not knowing if it’s real found footage was brilliant.  I also loved Wedding Crashers in college, although I remember feeling duped that it sorta changed genres halfway through and the trailer didn’t hint at that. But it stands a rewatchable. Hairspray, Pink Flamingos, and Silence of the Lambs all got attention in the comments. And Diner got a lot of love. That was a favorite when my dad showed me as a youth. 

Today’s state is Minnesota, so let’s see what’s in the cold weather states. 
Fargo won’t be taken here, even though it’s a largely Minnesota movie, I made the exception for North Dakota because, well, Fargo is the exception to many rules, dontchaknow.

barbie	movies	18xqgha	1704307269	On the infamous monologue in ‘Barbie’…	"I think almost everyone misinterpreted the point of the monologue and the movie as a whole; I can pull evidence from throughout the movie but will focus on the monologue in this post. I’ve had this thought since watching the movie on release day but was only motivated to write this after reading Ferrara’s recent NYT interview.

To me, the entire point of the movie is to demonstrate the absurdity of the gender divide and convince people to treat each other as fellow humans rather than members of an opposing group. The monologue seemed like a subtle critical take on Andrew Tate/Jordan Peterson-style motivational speeches intended for one gender. Hot take but I’ll explain:

As pointed out by many others, almost all of the monologue applies to humans writ-large, not just women. All the points are valid, but the way it’s delivered basically victimizes an entire gender and implies it’s the other gender’s fault (Tate should be taking notes). The reasonable next step from hearing the monologue seems to be to fight the oppressors so they can be free of these problems. And of course, the oppressors must be physically/culturally different from you because otherwise you’d be allies. Whether it’s Peterson or Ferrara, the gender divide is real and why you’re unhappy. They both subtly discount the idea that life is naturally hard and convince you that other people are the source of your problems.

I only got to that comparison by seeing how the monologue is actually used in the movie. Ferrera’s character uses it to “deprogram” all the Barbies, then the immediate next step for them was to lie and gaslight the Kens together.  They lead them on and take advantage of their masculine tendencies to manipulate them into fighting. Ultimately, that’s used to “save” Barbieland by blocking the Kens from voting and reverting everything back to the original state. The gender divide has been saved! Hurray?

From the perspective of equality in rights and representation, the Barbies acted pretty “evil” in that sequence and it seems like the movie is aware of that when it shows Robbie’s character slightly frowning in the middle of the Barbies celebrating their victory. The Barbies do eventually give concessions after Gosling’s character’s breakdown, but it’s played off as a joke about irl representation. I think people think this is where the movie ends, and therefore represents the overall message of the story. But what story does that tell? Listen to a monologue, lie to your peers, let them squabble, and win by default (with minor concessions)? I doubt Gerwig and Baumbach intended that to be the takeaway, and I think the movie says much more that most viewers have been ignoring.

The movie actually ends when Barbie becomes a human and goes to her gynecologist, effectively accepting the challenges of being a woman. From my viewing, that was the takeaway: understanding reality as it is and dealing with it even if it sucks. She even had a whole conversation about that exact topic with the creator of Barbie right before this!

To me, the monologue was actually antithetical to this point since it frames a lot of problems that most people face as problems that only women face, effectively enforcing the gender divide. The monologue is then used to motivate the Barbies into further enforcing a gender divide by lying to the Kens so they fight and lose their chance at official representation in the government. At no point does the monologue cause the Barbies to reflect on Barbieland or their own actions, and instead just makes them willing to deceive others for their own gain. This isn’t acceptance of anything, it’s just the Barbies dictating control on their terms at the expense of others.

Now I very much think Barbieland is supposed to be an inverse of the real world so this entire plot is intended to make men re-evaluate their thoughts on a patriarchal society. But that implies the Barbies are in the wrong throughout the whole movie, including after the monologue. All the monologue really did was incite conflict. With the inverted roles in mind, that’s actually kind of obvious since all Andrew Tate’s “motivational” rants have done irl is radicalize a bunch of impressionable boys. But that’s also why the response to the monologue has been so bizarre to me, because it’s like rewarding Jordan Peterson for saying things about men and masculinity. He actually makes some good points about life in general, but uses them to reinforce the gender divide with clearly toxic consequences. He deserves anything but praise and softball interviews from respected journalists, yet here we are on the other side.

What muddles everything is how the Barbies got “brainwashed” in the first place, which is never explained beyond Ken bringing the patriarchy to Barbieland. The surface level interpretation is that the Kens forcibly programmed the Barbies, which would make them genuinely bad and justify fighting back. But there is no evidence for that at all, it just kinda happened overnight without explanation. Not sure if that was intentional or if something was cut, but most people just jumped to the conclusion that the Kens did something bad to the Barbies despite the ambiguity.

I’m happy to be proven wrong by Gerwig but until then, I think the monologue is a bait and quite literally everyone fell for it. People are people, and we should treat them as such."	/r/movies/comments/18xqgha/on_the_infamous_monologue_in_barbie/	https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/18xqgha/on_the_infamous_monologue_in_barbie/

indiana_jones	movies	1e50psd	1721166006	That Time When Movie Trailers Used Other Movies' Soundtracks as a Score	"Back in the day, trailers were frequently scored with the soundtracks of other films. This is something that has always made my geeky little heart smile.

Sure enough, the trailer used the music he wrote for *Backdraft* (1991)!

The third one made by J.J. Abrams is about him settling down with his wife. It showed us how the stakes are ever rising and how his wife isn't safe with him till he doesn't leave the profession for good.

Ive tried changing the colorspace settings (BT.2020, DCI-P3) but no matter what colorspace setting I use, I cant seem to get an accurate skin color (in my opinion) The TV is calibrated but nonprofessionally.

sound_of_freedom	movies	174bhol	1696908725	I did not like Sound of Freedom	"Hey, so I understand this is a very controversial opinion about a very controversial movie. I'm going to try my absolute best to not say anything that would cause a fight, because the last thing I want to do is argue. Please keep in mind that this is my opinion, and I am making this post because I want to hear constructive opinions from other people on why they either like or dislike this movie.

When I saw Sound of Freedom, I didn't really like it all that much, but felt it wasn't really right for me to say that out loud, so when people asked me what I thought of the movie, I just said: ""I didn't really like it; Wasn't for me.""

If they ask me to explain further, I would usually just point at the bit during the credits where the main actor literally asks the audience to donate money to them- Keep in mind that apparently none of this money would be going towards any sort of organization that actually combats the issues brought up in the movie, but rather the money would simply go towards making a sequel or something I believe is what they said. They also talked about how it apparently took 5 years for the movie to get released- Now yeah, I know that sucks and everything, and I don't mean to compare this controversial movie towards a superhero movie, But what about things like Superman Lives or Batgirl? Movies that get so close to being finished, and then get canceled at the last minute? Tons of movies. Try to get off the ground and barely get anywhere, yes, it obviously sucks beyond comprehension to put so much effort and to making a movie and then have to spend so much more effort just to convince a studio to release it, but they were acting like it was some novel new concept, and like this wasn't something that tons of filmmakers have to go through multiple times in their lives.

Plus, I don't really care what your movie is about. I don't think it's a good move to literally turn to the audience and try to appeal to their emotion to literally try and organize a crowdfund for a sequel. I think I get what they were going for, and it was a smart move to get the main actor out there to make it more personal, but it just felt very manipulative.

I felt pretty crazy talking about that though, because basically everyone else I knew loved the movie, and anyone I knew who was heavily Christian (as in, Christian to the point that they are reluctant to watch literally anything that isn't directly related to Christianity, and they will flat out call any horror movie, including the upcoming Five Nights at Freddy's movie, to be ""satanic"" and not to be released (how ironic)), said that while they acknowledge that the movie was not connected to religion, they still felt it was very ""important"" or something.

When I look for criticisms of the movie though, they usually fall under some sort of conspiracy theory, which I try to steer clear from. To me, I'm not going to go ahead and say that the issue in the movie isn't real, because it's not like I know everything that happens in the world, but it's just the apparent issue isn't exactly a secret, to my knowledge. Anyway. The exact same lesson the movie was trying to give way back when I was 7 years old watching a ""special episode"" of Different Strokes- In fact, that family sitcom made 2 whole ""special episodes"" covering the dangers of hitchhiking and dealing with child abuse. (Actually, there was even another regular episode where Arnold's Friend is worried his Dad is going to lose everything due to his smoking habit and so he even claims to other people that his Dad struck him without realizing how much trouble that would cause until the end of the Episode).

There's this movie called The Hunt from 2012 which basically turns this entire concept on its head when a teacher is falsely accused of abusing a child, and the movie very disturbingly shows how his entire sense of community completely falls apart based on a false charge that everyone around him believes despite there being no evidence. Maybe I just have the wrong perspective on life, but I feel that movie had more to say than Sound of Freedom.

I'm sure if I watched the movie again I might be able to think of more things I felt wrong about, but I'm not going all the way to the theater to watch it again, so I have a much rather ask you guys what you think."	/r/movies/comments/174bhol/i_did_not_like_sound_of_freedom/	https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/174bhol/i_did_not_like_sound_of_freedom/

::Update:: Thank you all for the feedback! I watched Oppenheimer tonight (7/28) and decided to watch it in IMAX. I enjoyed watching it on the larger screen. So I feel good about that decision. I disagree with the comments about this film not being great. I really enjoyed it. Cillian Murphy deserves an Oscar for this one. However, I will say I was underwhelmed with the big explosion scene. Even with the better sound, it didn’t live up to the hype. I feel like Nolan should’ve done that with CGI for an even greater effect. Just imo."	/r/flicks/comments/159wwk1/oppenheimer_in_regular_70mm_or_imax/	https://www.reddit.com/r/flicks/comments/159wwk1/oppenheimer_in_regular_70mm_or_imax/	
oppenheimer	TrueFilm	18ep7un	1702162134	Fast-paced, big budget biopics like Napoleon (Scott) and Oppenheimer (Nolan) don't take the intellectual capacity of their viewers seriously	"Both Napoleon and Oppenheimer where extraordinary figures in extraordinary times. Napoleon lived in the days where the Enlightenment culminated into the French Revolution. Oppenheimer helped introduce a new era of modernity where for the first time science had the potential to destroy human civilization as we know it.

Oppenheimer is a way better movie than Napoleon, but neither Scott nor Nolan manage to capture the dialectic between their protagonists and the times they lived in. Just by watching Oppenheimer we don't understand quantum mechanics, American communism and it's popularity among intellectuals, nor does watching Napoleon make us understand the French Revolution, the Enlightenment or the tactics of Napoleonic warfare.

As a consequence we also don't truly get to understand Oppenheimer and Napoleon. These people where not just quirky figures who out of brilliance lacked social etiquette. They where political and intellectual beasts who applied new ideas to their respective times.

Instead of some slower dialogues explaining quantum mechanics or all the profound political debate going on in the French revolution, we get witty lines in fast paced dialogues to illustrate apparent intelligence, but we don't get to learn what these people were actually discussing or thinking about. We get impressions of their ideas and their personas at best. We're not invited into the discussion. Instead, we're put in the position of the semi-confused bystander who sip their martini's while the big shots ramble on about complicated stuff while we're nodding and pretending we understand.

This is especially true for Ridley Scott's Napoleon. With Oppenheimer, we do see the political manoeuvring of Oppenheimer, but we don't get to understand quantum mechanics, nor do we understand why so many physicists where revolutionary communists.

With Oppenheimer, you can at least argue how the fast-paced cuts served some purpose, namely the spiraling into madness of the monomanic scientists. By developing a new weapon, they wanted to test their quickly developing quantum mechanics in order to themselves better understand them regardless of the human consequences. This in a context of a dazzling antifascist war effort, quickly followed by a communist red scare and an arms race. The trailer-like editing kinda makes us feel how these physicists got tangled up in turbulent political and scientific developments and quickly got disillusioned and isolated. I however feel it all remains very superficial.

With Napoleon however we just get... costumes. And a horribly acted Napoleon being weird and power hungry. It's just big man politics to illustrate Napoleons grandeur. But even with this grandeur we must say that Phoenix simply does a bad job. Napoleon was in reality young, energetic, ad rem, politically crafty,... Phoenix however looks like like he conquering Europe on xannies while getting bored by politics.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel this is a general problem with big budget biopics aimed at wide audiences. I'm honestly thinking many directors don't truly understand the people and periods they're making movies about. Or maybe they're afraid we won't be unable to understand a difficult message? If that's the case, they get the reverse effect.

Ironically, by dumbing down the message and only giving us snippets of information to give us a mere impression of a historical figure, the directors chose the exact best way to leave as many viewers puzzled as possible. To quote Einstein: ""If you can't explain something simply, you don't understand it well enough.""

I have a feeling many of these big shot directors are good manager-type figures, but horrible intellectuals. I sometimes meet movie industry people and honestly, except for those who're really into writing scenarios, I'm rarely impressed conversing with them.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

My take on how Napoleon could have been a better movie:

**Napoleon** was not only a military genius who realized the full potential of the new military technology (modern artillery), but also was a skillful politician who had a coming-of-age in a period of enlightenment, leading to join the ranks of a revolution that trembled the world.

It's very common to overlook the politician Napoleon, but even his military genius is not depicted well by Scott. We get zero insight in the military tactics of that time: disciplined professional soldiers, officers being allowed to take initiative by Napoleon, line infantry shooting of a well timed volley or two before charging with the bayonette, the harassing role of skirmishers tempting to distract enemy line infantry, cavalry exploiting wavering infantry platoons, mass artillery to create a shock effect,...

These were all important military developments that we don't get to see. Scott's movie is just armies clashing into each other in a big, chaotic brawl. Why even bother bringing a rifle if you're only gonna fight melee? And concerning Napoleon's role on the battlefield? In Scott's movie he just waves to order the big guns to shoot at the decisive moment. I know Corsicans like Napoleon gesticulate a lot, but in reality the ability to communicate on a large battlefield spanning many hectares was a feat of itself. We however get some messagers, lights signals and some flag waving here and there. We do not grasp the challenge of structuring a chaotic battlefield environment. This is something a stupid film like We were soldiers portrays better.

But even worse is the quasi total absence of politics in Scott's Napoleon. Napoleon was a young ambitious man who spend most of his teenage and adolescent years reading the Enlightenment philosophers like the radical Rousseau and the more moderate Voltaire.

Napoleon believed the privileged aristocracy of his day should be get rid of in order modernize and equalize society, paving way for up and coming dynamic commoners like himself. He was a somewhat awkward military cadet in a French officer school who found it difficult to make friends because of his intellect, his Italian-ness and of course ego and ambition. This is why he delved into philosophy, history, military theory,... He was an intellectual beast. This political coming of age, however, is nowhere in the film, nor is his later moderation of his Enlightened ideas.

Napoleon comes in when the French revolution splits into a more radical and a more moderate current. The radicals (like Marat and Robespierre) wanted to expand the new political rights to the new and quickly growing working class, as well as to the black slaves in the colonies. The moderates however only wanted to get rid of the aristocracy, but wanted exclude those without property.

As a youngster, Napoleon was more radical, but quickly evolved to become a moderate after seeing Robespierres terror and, of course, after climbing through the ranks of the army. As he said himself in 1803: *""I would have fought to the death for Rousseau against all the friends of Voltaire. Today, it's the other way.""* Rousseau is today sometimes viewed as a proto-communist, while Voltaire was in favor of an enlightened sovereign who modernized society from above. Napoleon clearly evolved towards a more moderate revolutionary, not only because of his ambition, but also intellectually.

Why and how? After Robespierres terror against every suspected counter-revolutionary, France was in chaos, both politically as economically. The monarchies surrounding France feasted on this chaos by conquering ever more territory of the once so powerful French state.

Then came in Napoleon: wanting to defend the revolution against the encroaching monarchist armies, but willing to exclude the radicals like Marat and the *sans-culottes* (working class revolutionaries). He however was still anti-aristocratic, hence his shooting down of the monarchist rebellion (one of the few the things Scott depicts well). In order to appease the sentiment in rural catholic France, Napoleon restores the historical line between the Vatican and Paris.

So what remains of the once so radical young Napoleon? Less and less as time goes on. He re-instates slavery and oppresses working class revolutionaries and runs pro-business policies like standardizing the measuring and weighing system (boosting trade and creating a national economy). With his Code Napoleon, he creates a sturdy rule of law to lure investments. These pro-capitalist policies mixed with populism and oppression of the emerging left. Betraying the revolution against the people wihtin and defending the revolution against the aristocracy attacking from without. THAT is Napoleon. However non of that in the Napoleon movie."	/r/TrueFilm/comments/18ep7un/fastpaced_big_budget_biopics_like_napoleon_scott/	https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/18ep7un/fastpaced_big_budget_biopics_like_napoleon_scott/

indiana_jones	movies	1jlnw55	1743139539	Raiders of the Lost Ark is the weakest Indiana Jones film	"Before you have me hung, drawn and quartered, hear me out, I love Raiders and I love all the Indiana Jones films in their own way and none of them are bad I just enjoy the other films more. Also, I'm not going to do the Big Bang Theory thing where Amy says “Indiana Jones plays no role in the outcome of the story. ""If he weren’t in the movie, the Nazis would still have found the Ark, taken it to the island, opened it up, and all died, just like they did,” because it's a stupid argument to point out Raiders' flaws as it was the first film. Of course, it would have flaws. Even with the knowledge, it doesn't ruin the film or the franchise, plus she can never ruin The Last Crusade (my favourite Indy film). Also its not just the weakest of the trilogy but of the entire franchise which includes Kingdom of the Crystal Skull and Dial of Destiny.

While Raiders of the Lost Ark is still a classic action-adventure film, the plot while very enjoyable is also very paint by numbers with a very anticlimactic ending. I guess I expected more, but after being hyped about how amazing this film is, I just found it to be just good and not great. I think that Raiders is the weakest film in the franchise as I think the other films improve on the formula that Raiders created, especially Last Crusade. But I still like it, with stunts, explosions, comedy, thills, horror and Nazis being killed. Raiders will forever be a classic."	/r/movies/comments/1jlnw55/raiders_of_the_lost_ark_is_the_weakest_indiana/	https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1jlnw55/raiders_of_the_lost_ark_is_the_weakest_indiana/	
mi7	movies	1kw5kt9	1748293628	May 23-25 Box Office Recap – It was the biggest Memorial Day weekend in history. 'Lilo &amp; Stitch' debuted with a colossal $341 million worldwide, while 'Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning' debuted with $204 million worldwide.	"https://preview.redd.it/veq3xk1ey63f1.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2abc6ed70f57166cfe3163e0f00b28d593335138

It was a record breaking Memorial Day weekend.

Disney's live-action remake of ***Lilo &amp; Stitch*** opened with the best Memorial Day debut, as well as the third biggest debut for any live-action remake. ***Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning*** also reached franchise highs this weekend, although its numbers are overshadowed by its colossal budget.

The Top 10 earned a combined $260.8 million this weekend. That's not just a colossal 166.8% up from last year, but it was the biggest Memorial Day weekend in history.

Easily earning the #1 spot, ***Lilo &amp; Stitch*** debuted with a gigantic $145.5 million this weekend ($183 million four-day). That's the biggest Memorial Day debut, passing ***Top Gun: Maverick*** ($126 million, $160 million four-day). It's also the third biggest debut for a Disney live-action remake, just behind 2019's ***The Lion King*** ($191 million) and 2017's ***Beauty and the Beast*** ($174 million).

That's absolutely impressive, considering the original film made $145.7 million domestically back in 2002 (yes, the remake has already outgrossed it in just four days). So how did it open that high, especially considering other animated films had higher box office?

Simply put, Stitch has been a merchandising monster for the past decades. It's been a main point of attention in Disney Parks, as well as in other venues. There's a lot of toys, shirts, caps, bedsheets, etc., with the character attached. The film has also grown massively through home media, cable reruns and streaming, particularly with Millennials and Gen Z. Contrary to the belief, Gen Z still likes going to theaters, and their familiarity with Stitch helped.

The original animated film had a crazy marketing campaign, where Stitch crashed other Disney animated films, which helped raise awareness. Disney used a similar tactic with the remake; some posters have Stitch messing with other remakes like ***Aladdin***, ***Cinderella***, ***Snow White***, and ***Beauty and the Beast***. Not to mention a spot in Super Bowl LIX, where Stitch ""interrupted"" the kickoff. It's simply a case of a pretty great marketing campaign.

It's crazy to think that this was going to be straight to Disney+. Whoever decided to shift that just earned a raise. And while Disney is often known for their large amount of money spent on productions, ***Lilo &amp; Stitch*** came in far lower. It cost just $100 million, which is quite cheap. And if you watched the final version of the film, it clearly shows.

According to Disney, 64% of the audience was female. As previously said, Millennials and Gen Z loved the franchise and the data supports it: a massive 79% of the audience was under 35. Reviews were middling (68% on RT), but the audience was much more forgiving: they gave it a great ""A"" on CinemaScore. Even with some family competition on its way, ***Lilo &amp; Stitch*** should easily get to $500 million domestically. 

This franchise will self destruct in 8 films.

In second place, ***Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning*** debuted with $64 million ($77.5 million four-day) in 3,857 theaters. That's the franchise's biggest debut, although it comes with an asterisk in terms of attendance. Adjusted for inflation, it's the third lowest debut, just behind ***Ghost Protocol*** and ***Dead Reckoning***.

On its own, when a franchise hits a high at the box office for its final outing, it should feel celebratory. So why is this not considered a great start? Perhaps for the fact that the film cost a staggering $400 million to produce (although some have it lower at $300 million), making it one of the most expensive films ever made. Why did it cost that much?

While films film around a few months, some blockbusters can last longer. But in the case of ***The Final Reckoning***, it was even bigger. Filming started in March 2022 with certain sections of the film, followed by a break. Then in 2023, production was halted after the WGA-SAG strike. Once they were allowed to film, they still needed to pay for actors' availability and rewrites, complicating matters. As such, the film didn’t wrap until November 2024. It wasn't a continuous shoot, and the film paid the crew despite months of not working on the film. No one involved in the film went into this expecting it to cost that much.

With all that said, it still raises the question: the film couldn't open at least higher than this? Sure, it's a franchise best, but considering it's barely above ***Fallout*** ($61 million) and it's sold as the absolute final film, it feels like it could've been higher. But it looks like the franchise simply has a ceilling at the box office. One of its biggest challenges was adding fans with time, but here's the thing: this franchise is 29 years old. Fans of the franchise will watch it, but it's unlikely it can add new fans. After all, the attendance peaked with the second film ($401 million adjusted).

So the film was sold simply as a send-off for Tom Cruise. To the point that the trailers emphasized the ""I need you to trust me one last time"" line. For the past years, Cruise and McQuarrie have said that this wouldn't be the end and that Cruise was looking forward to play the character for years. But that was put to rest a few days ago, when Cruise finally confirmed that the title of the film pretty much says it all: it's not called ***The Final Reckoning*** for nothing. The franchise has been a critical darling for the past few entries, and while reviews were positive (80% on RT), it wasn't as acclaimed as the previous films.

According to Paramount, 63% of the audience was male. The film had no appeal for young audiences: 62% of the audience was 35 and over, with its biggest demo being 55 and over (29%). That shouldn't be a surprise. They gave it a solid ""A–"" on CinemaScore, although it's below both ***Fallout*** and ***Dead Reckoning***. The film will enjoy a 3-week exclusive run in IMAX, as part of a deal secured back in 2023. But with competition on its way, it's very unlikely ***The Final Reckoning*** could hit $200 million domestically. 

Last week's champ ***Final Destination: Bloodlines*** added $19.3 million ($23.9 million four-day). That represents a steep 62% drop from last week, which is worse than both ***The Final Destination*** (54.9%) and ***Final Destination 5*** (57.3%). Looks like the film will be playing like a standard horror film, but considering it's already the highest grossing film in the franchise, it's not like it matters much. Through 11 days, the film has earned $94.1 million, and it should close with around $130 million domestically.

In fourth place, ***Thunderbolts*** dropped 45%, adding $9.1 million this weekend ($11.8 million four-day). The film hasn't fully collapsed, but it hasn't held very well neither, thanks to a large slate of competition. Through Monday, the film has earned $174 million and it's gonna be struggling to hit $200 million at this rate.

***Sinners*** earned $8.6 million this weekend ($11 million), which represents a 43% drop, its biggest so far. Which just speaks volumes of what an insane run it has had so far. The film has earned $258.8 million, and it should get close to $290 million by the end of its run.

In sixth place, Angel Studios' ***The Last Rodeo*** debuted with $5.2 million ($6.2 million four-day) in 2,205 theaters. The film got an ""A"" on CinemaScore, and it should earn over $15 million domestically.

Even more good news this weekend. A24 expanded ***Friendship*** into wide release, and the film earned a very solid $4.5 million ($5.5 million four-day) in 1,055 theaters. That's pretty good, especially considering the selling point is pretty much just Tim Robinson and Paul Rudd. The film has amassed $7.6 million so far, and it should continue adding screenings.

In eighth place, ***A Minecraft Movie*** was clearly hit by the newcomers. It collapsed 63%, its biggest drop so far, earning $2.2 million this weekend ($2.8 million four-day). The film has earned $421 million so far, and it will finish with around $430 million domestically.

***The Accountant 2*** dropped 59% and added $1.9 million ($2.5 million) this weekend. That takes its domestic total to $63.3 million, and it's gonna close with less than $70 million lifetime.

Rounding up the Top 10 was ***Hurry Up Tomorrow***, which managed to lose over 500 theaters on its second weekend. The film collapsed a brutal 78%, making just $715,000 this weekend ($860,000 four-day). That's simply horrible, but not surprising considering the film's terrible word of mouth. The film has earned $4.9 million, and it won't make it pass $6 million domestically.

#**OVERSEAS**

***Lilo &amp; Stitch*** was also incredibly strong overseas. The film debuted with a colossal $158.7 million overseas, for a gigantic $341 million worldwide debut. Basically, in one single weekend, it already outgrossed the worldwide lifetime of the original. The best debuts were in Mexico ($23.7M), UK ($12.9M), Brazil ($11.1M), France ($10.7M) and Italy ($9.2M). This is an easy billion.

***Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning*** debuted with $127 million overseas, which was a $204 million worldwide debut, another franchise record. Its best debuts were in South Korea ($12.7M), Japan ($11M), the UK ($10.7M), India ($9M), France ($7.8M), Australia ($7.7M), Taiwan ($6.3M),  Germany ($6M), Mexico ($3.9M), UAE ($3.6M) and Hong Kong ($3.3M).

There's been talks over how the film is going to recoup its $400 million budget. Deadline reported something and here's the thing: it won't. The film by itself is going to lose a lot of money in theaters. But it also notes that Paramount is playing the long game: the value of franchise properties increases with each subsequent installment and across multiple revenue streams. So Paramount can be able to profit with multiple ""The Complete Franchise"" deals in home media and streaming. It's gonna take a long time for that, but it's gonna be a big asset. And even if it doesn't, what's gonna happen? Cancel the franchise? It's already over.

***Final Destination: Bloodlines*** added $23 million overseas, taking its worldwide total to $186.7 million. It has already passed ***The Final Destination*** to become the highest grossing film in the franchise, achieving it in just 2 weekends. The best markets are the UK ($9.2M), Mexico ($9.2M), Philippines ($6M), India ($6M) and France ($5M). It will cross $200 million in the next few days, and it will finish with around $270 million worldwide. Truly impressive.

If you thought ***Thunderbolts*** was struggling domestically, it pretty much died this weekend in the rest of the world. The film collapsed a horrible 64% and added just $5.6 million, taking its worldwide total to $355 million. Clearly the arrival of Stitch and Tom Cruise took a toll on its overseas prospects. Well, we gave it the benefit of the doubt, but now it's guaranteed to finish below $400 million. As such, we finally a consensus: this is a box office flop.

*Captain America: Brave New World* | Feb/14 | Disney | $88,842,603 | $200,500,001 | $415,101,577 | $180M

- You should've done better, Marvel. ***Captain America: Brave New World*** has ended its run with just $200 million domestically and $415 million worldwide. Given that its budget was $180 million, we can safely call this a box office failure. It didn't fully collapse from its weak reception, given that it had very small competition for a lot of weeks. Nevertheless, its 2.26x multiplier is quite bad. It's not a surprise, considering the film itself is a Frankenstein's Monster that fails to properly delve into any of its themes or ideas. What's Marvel gonna do now? Especially considering the better received ***Thunderbolts*** is set to finish below this? 

#**THIS WEEKEND**

With such a huge debut, ***Lilo &amp; Stitch*** ain't losing the top spot this weekend.

Sony is releasing ***Karate Kid: Legends***, the sixth film in franchise, starring Jackie Chan, Ben Wang, and Ralph Macchio. The franchise has been massively popular, and the success of ***Cobra Kai*** on Netflix has helped it add new fans over the years. But the decision to sandwich the film between two anticipated family films (***Lilo &amp; Stitch*** and ***How to Train Your Dragon***) is concerning. Will the audience pay a ticket or just wait for streaming?

A24 is also releasing the horror film ***Bring Her Back***, which is directed by Danny and Michael Philippou (***Talk to Me***). That film was a sleeper hit back in 2023, earning $90 million worldwide. Will they strike gold again?

And on limited release, there's Wes Anderson's ***The Phoenician Scheme***, starring Benicio del Toro, Mia Threapleton, Michael Cera, Riz Ahmed, Tom Hanks, Bryan Cranston, Mathieu Amalric, Richard Ayoade, Jeffrey Wright, Scarlett Johansson, Benedict Cumberbatch, Rupert Friend, and Hope Davis. The film has already premiered in Cannes, where it earned a very solid response. Anderson's films often deliver high numbers on limited release, so look for this film to deliver the year's best per-theater average.

barbie	movies	19bpypw	1705795656	Poor things, Barbie and Priscilla reflect the discourses and feminist progression of a few years ago	"Just saw Poor Things this evening, adored it. Felt like Brazil meet Metropolis meets Frankenstein (or The Bride of Frankenstein) and definitely lots of other wonderful references I can’t think of right now. Perhaps could have done with further editing and I would have like some of the sex aspects to be approached in a more nuanced way. But that’s all besides the point. 

I also watched Priscilla last week and adored that too as I’m a big Sofia Coppola fan. 

Along with Barbie which also shared some similar themes and messages to the other above films (while they’re all of course completely different), it’s interesting to note quite how feminist all these recent films have been. Really digging deep into the female experience and what it means to be a woman in our society. With that said, I also notice that feminist discourse seems to have slowly lulled somewhat within the past couple of years. However from around 2016-2020 I feel that feminist discourse was a really hot topic especially with the likes of me too and a lot of other things we were seeing in the media. I can’t know when the initial idea for each of these films were conceived but I can only guess they may have landed somewhere on this time period if not the later end (especially as covid will have delayed the production of a lot of films that are now coming out). I just found this an interesting observation since in our fast paced world we consume so much media that is immediately on the pulse of the conversation that sometimes we don’t consider how things like movies and books don’t have that same immediacy, and while these films might prompt us to presume that they’re reflecting back the cultural moment they’re actually just reflecting the period of progression we had several years back. We could be fooled into thinking that because we’re seeing films like this, everyone must be thinking similarly when from what I’ve seen, misogyny appears to be worse online than I’ve seen in years. 

Do you think these films actually have any effect on where we’re at? Or do you think people leave the cinema, chat about them a bit and they simply remain as think pieces. I don’t have any one specific thought, just a collection of observations after seeing a brilliant film and would love anyone’s opinions."	/r/movies/comments/19bpypw/poor_things_barbie_and_priscilla_reflect_the/	https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/19bpypw/poor_things_barbie_and_priscilla_reflect_the/

barbie	movies	1aba7qy	1706244590	What makes a director great according to the Academy?	"As you may have guessed, I’m asking because of outrage over the Barbie movie’s the best director snub for the Oscar nominations. Even though I loved the movie I’m actually not mad Greta Gerwig didn’t get nominated.

Because:

1. She was nominated for the categories I know in fact she deserved like best writing for an adaptation and best picture.
2. I don’t really know what makes a great director. Nor do I know what the academy is looking for.
3. The Oscar’s have always kinda felt unfair to me so…the fact that the Barbie movie got nominated in several categories, a Native American actress was nominated for best actress for the first time in history, 2 black women and a Latina woman were nominated for best supporting actress, and an Afro-Latino man was nominated for best actor feels like a win to me.

Anyway, I really only saw 3 of the movies that have any kind of 2024 Oscar nomination: Barbie, Poor Things, and The Color Purple. 

I loved all 3. 

Both Barbie and Poor Things have nominations for writing of a screen adaptation and for best picture but only Poor Things has a nomination for best director. Both have nominations for supporting actors but only Poor Things has a nomination for best actress. The Academy clearly has appreciation for the acting and story for both movies. But I guess the Barbie movie didn’t have what they were looking for as far as direction? 

The only time I know a director is superior is if an actor does poorly under one director but performs great under another. For this idk. I love Yorgos Lanthimos work for the Lobster and for Poor Things but I can’t really tell you why (I didn’t really like The Favourite. Sorry to say it 🤷🏽‍♀️) 

Just wondered if you had any thoughts as to what might have been missing in the Barbie movie direction-wise because idk. Some ppl might say sexism but Greta was nominated in other categories so I get the feeling that’s the answer click baity answer. Or some have said because it wasn’t that good which is clearly not the answer either since it was nominated in other categories.

So just wondering if any movie experts can tell me what gives a director critical acclaim."	/r/movies/comments/1aba7qy/what_makes_a_director_great_according_to_the/	https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1aba7qy/what_makes_a_director_great_according_to_the/	
mi7	movies	1h03310	1732594049	2023 Alternate Oscar Nominations: One Nom Per Movie	"So I've made it no secret how much I loved 2023 but I also really did like the Oscar nominations this year. But it still saddens me how many great movies only got a single nom or went 0 for nominations.

I already did an alternate Oscar noms a while back but I thought of different idea. I wanted to spread the love as much as possible and so came my biggest project to date: the 2023 Oscars with each movie only eligible for one nom. Even Best Picture nominees only get that Best Picture nom. I watched as many movies as I could to fill this list up which was a bit tiring but still rewarding with how many discoveries I made.

To give myself some ease, as a rule given how broad the field is, I did only look at the submissions for Best International Feature as to not find up having to go through dozens of other films (luckily this year's noms were all really good). I also did the same for documentaries and what were shortlisted entries but again, a lot of the shortlisted documentaries were all fantastic so no complaints there.

I did also try to be as objective and fair. There are several movies I didn't care for or didn't like overall such as Maestro, Origin, and Showing Up but I could acknowledge one element that really did work that's at least worth recognizing. I didn't want this just to be a list of movies I personally loved ~~(that'll be a different list)~~

And in terms of how I chose which movie went were, it was rather simple.

The Best Picture and Best Directing noms for instance would perhaps be the most well rounded in terms of derserving noms in acting, screenplay, directing, production, score, editing, etc. Poor Things just being relegated to acting would feel wrong given how much of that movie is impressive.

In terms of acting, it had to be for movies who rested on their central performance, even if the writing is thin or abstract thus why A Thousand and One, 20000 Species of Bees, The Iron Claw, Perfect Days, etc. got acting nominations. It's also why I actually moved Teachers' Lounge out of the Best Actress and into Best Screenplay, I just feel that movie is so sharply written, it would feel wrong to just give it an acting nomination. And speaking of screenplay, given how a ton more praise is given to its story, I graduated Godzilla Minus One from VFX to Adapted Screenplay (that and I actually watched Origin and seeing how badly written it was, had to replace it with something)

Song and Score I judged how they fit well outside of the film and how much they would be enjoyed.

Production was straightforward but I did want to shout out Taste of Things because all of the food there was made onsite and that's part of the production and is a character of the film in and of itself.

The others are self-explanatory though I will say I went back and forth between movies in Make-Up and movies in costumes. Both had similar praise.

Unfortunately, I can't add all graphics I made so here

oppenheimer	movies	1c0z7rf	1712789667	What makes for good marketing nowadays and how do you make people go to the cinema for an all-original film?	"I'm new to marketing and been analyzing movie marketing for a little bit but most huge films nowadays are either sequels, prequels or based on a book / brand / franchise, there are also other factors like famous actors, the internet, good reviews and big name directors...

the concept of familiarity is very big, you won't spend your money on something you don't know, but how do you market an all-new film and market it well for it to be a huge film.

Films like Barbie are pretty easy to see why it became huge but something like Oppenheimer is pretty fascinating how it became as huge as it did, when I look at Oppenheimer's marketing it's pretty barebone and laid back. Although the barbenheimer phenomenon and Christopher Nolan are definitely big selling points but that can't be even close to a part of why it became that huge.

Also something like Avatar is fascinating to me, all new franchise near 3 hour movie and it's the biggest movie of all time, that can't be just because it's James Cameron, what made it that people needed to go see Avatar?

These were some examples of big movies I thought of right now, but there are loads more (La La Land, A Star Is Born, American Sniper, Inception, Inside Out, Gravity...)

All I'm asking is what qualifies as great marketing, what makes people want to get out their seats and head to the movies? And an even better question, what makes you want to head to the movies?"	/r/movies/comments/1c0z7rf/what_makes_for_good_marketing_nowadays_and_how_do/	https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1c0z7rf/what_makes_for_good_marketing_nowadays_and_how_do/

I want this discussion to be more about your thoughts and reflections on the films and how they've been so far in terms of styles and perhaps themes and messages. 

Like how the cinematography is, the kinds of stories we're seeing and the writing style, maybe even the types of characters? In different genres? 

From big blockbusters like Top Gun: Maverick, Oppenheimer, Barbie, to surprise hits like Everything Everywhere All At Once; noteworthy international films like The Worst Person in the World and Anatomy of a Fall; horror films such as Pearl and Talk To Me. 

Every decade of films have a certain 'something' about them, that separate them from other decades and eras.

barbie	movies	1cuanib	1715965847	In honor of Ryan Gosling’s long history of wearing cool jackets, I watched 26 of his films and figured out the percentage of time that they dedicate to Jacket Gosling (16.6% is the overall average). The 7%-12% (Notebook/Barbie/Half Nelson) and the 50%+  (Drive/Blade Runner 2049) ranges are ideal.	"Ryan Gosling loves jackets. Between *Drive, Blade Runner 2049, Crazy, Stupid, Love, Blue Valentine, Lars and the Real Girl, The Nice Guys*, and *Barbie* - he’s worn some iconic jackets in wildly different movies - and looked great in all of them. Between Gosling wearing five different jackets/coats/dusters in *The Fall Guy* ([The Miami Vice jacket](https://www.gq.com/story/the-miami-vice-stunt-show-from-the-fall-guy-is-real) is an all-timer Gosling jacket) and Shea Serrano’s book about Gosling ([A Real Human Being](https://sheaserrano.gumroad.com/l/khubp?layout=profile) - It’s wonderful) I was inspired to rewatch his movies, pull the timestamps of all his jacket wearing and figure out if there is an ideal amount of Gosling jacket time. 

Quick Notes

* I pulled the timestamps by finding scenes where he wears a jacket. It would’ve taken forever to only count his screen time, so I pulled the time of the entire scene. For instance, in *Blade Runner 2049* Gosling wears his jacket during the [attack on Deckard’s home scene](https://youtu.be/fQJH0G1neuc). He isn’t always on screen, but he’s in the scene (if that makes sense).
* I included the hoodie from *The United States of Leland* because it’s like an extension of his character
* In *Stay*, he wears a suit coat type jacket to stay warm. I counted this as a jacket/coat.
* I’m very happy I scanned the montage scenes in *Remember the Titans.*
* Suit coat time wasn’t counted. I also didn’t count Gosling’s gym hoodie in *The Big Short.*

**Gosling Jacket Stats**

* **Percentage of time Gosling wears a jacket in his 26 movies - 16.6%** 

**Gosling’s most jacket heavy roles**

* *Blade Runner 2049* - 60%
* *Drive* - 53%
* *The Gray Man* - 45%
* *The Believer* - 44%
* *The Slaughter Rule* - 43%

Quick Note - The Fall Guy falls in this category. I just don’t have exact times. 

**Five Gosling Movies With the Least Amount of jacket wearing** 

* *Song to Song* - 1%
* *First Man* - 1%
* *Remember the Titans* - .05% - He wears a jacket in the hospital and during a montage scene
* *Only God Forgives* - 0%
* *The Big Short* - 0%

**Gosling has been nominated for three acting Oscars** 

* *Barbie, Half Nelson, La La Land* - Average amount of jacket wearing time - 7%

**Gosling has been in three films nominated for Best Picture**

* *La La Land, Barbie, The Big Short* - Average amount of jacket wearing time - 4.6%

* Tomatometer - 91% - Highest average
* IMDb - 7.9 - Highest average
* Letterboxd - 4 - Highest average 
* Worldwide Box Office - $169.5 million average
* Two Movies -  *Drive - Blade Runner 2049*

With the inclusion of *The Fall Guy*, the numbers drop to 87.6% (RT), 7.7 (IMDb), and 3.86. They are still legit numbers.

**40 - 49%** 

* Tomatometer - 67%
* IMDb - 6.5
* Letterboxd - 3
* Worldwide Box Office - NA - The Gray Man (Netflix) and Believer/The Slaughter Rule didn’t have wide releases
* Three Movies - *The Gray Man, The Believer, The Slaughter Rule*

**30 - 39%**

* Tomatometer - 81%
* IMDb - 7.3

* IMDb - 7
* Letterboxd - 3.45
* Worldwide Box Office - $93 million
* 12 Movies - *Half Nelson, The United States of Leland, The Place Beyond the Pines, All Good Things, La La Land, Gangster Squad, Crazy, Stupid, Love, Song to Song, First Man, Remember the Titans, Only God Forgives, The Big Short*

**Overall Stats For Gosling’s 26 films (for reference)**

* Tomatometer - 68%
* IMDb -7
* Letterboxd - 3.4
* Box office - $138 million

**Ideal Amount of Jacket Wearing for Gosling - There are three percentage ranges to pick from.** 

**50% or more** - Between *Blade Runner 2049* (amazing jacket) and *Drive* (iconic jacket), both movies feature him wearing super cool jackets for long periods of time. To pull this off the jackets have to feel organic and become almost a character. The only caveat is that he needs to be mostly silent, mortally wounded (or stabbed real good), and alone at the end.

* *Drive* and *Blade Runner 2049* have the best critic/user score average, and the jacket in Drive is an all-timer jacket.
* *Drive* is his second all-around highest rated film (93% Tomatometer - 7.8 IMDb - 3.9 Letterboxd)
* *Blade Runner 2049* is his third highest rated film (88% - 8 - 4.1)

**7% - 12%** - *Half Nelson* (7%), *Blue Valentine* (10%), *Fracture* (10%), *Barbie* (12%) and *The Notebook* (12%) fall in this range. They are some heavy hitters that feature excellent coats and iconic Gosling performances. 

* *Barbie* and *Half Nelson* make up two of his three Oscar nominations. 
* *The Notebook* won him the coveted MTV Best Kiss Award
* His first Oscar nomination was for *Half Nelson*
* Golden Globe nominated for *Blue Valentine*
* *Barbie* is his highest grossing film

  
**2%** - His “Emma Stone” trilogy (*Crazy, Stupid, Love - Gangster Squad - La La Land*) all feature him wearing a jacket for 2% of the film’s running time. It’s a fun coincidence. 

* *La La Land* won Best Picture for about three seconds
* *La La Land* is second highest grossing film
* *La La Land* is his best all-around rated film (91- Tomatometer - 8 IMDb - 4.1 Metacritic)

**Overall winner**

If its directed by an auteur the 50%+ range is cool. BUT, he’s able to showcase more range in *Barbie, Half Nelson, The Notebook*, and *Blue Valentine*. It’s because of this that I’ll go for the 7% to 12% range. 

**Top five jackets**

1. *Drive* - The scorpion jacket works on several levels
2. *Blade Runner 2049* - It’s functional and cool looking
3. *Lars and the Real Girl* - I love a good puffer jacket. 
4. *The Place Beyond the Pines* - The red jacket is wonderful and it improves upon his red jacket work in *Murder by Numbers.*
5. *Barbie* - It’s big, bold and important to the plot

barbie	movies	18w33q6	1704134088	My 2023 movie viewing	"Seeing some of the posts on here and Edgar Wright's Twitter post about his 350+ movies watched, I am a little less proud of myself for hitting 135 movies this year.

oppenheimer	TrueFilm	1b6xwjy	1709617773	Oppenheimer: Why are biopics given leeway for underdeveloped writing?	"I enjoyed Oppenheimer, but it astounded me how many instances of writing in the movie would be completely shunned in any other movie, but are forgiven because this particular movie is a biopic. A few examples are:

1. Kitty’s abrupt shift in character. She is pretty one note (frustrated and angsty) throughout 95% of the movie, and then becomes proactive in the final 5% when it becomes time to give her testimony.

2. Rami Malek’s character, who doesn’t say a single line for most of the movie, and then suddenly plays a huge part in the outcome of the characters in the final 10 minutes. Can you imagine if an original movie had a nameless, voiceless character show up to drastically alter the plot out of nowhere?

3. The MCU-style reference to JFK.

These are just a few issues I had with the screenplay, in which it feels like Nolan expects that because of our knowledge of this movie as a biopic, we will project dimension and the to the characters where it doesn’t let exist. Should bad writing be given leeway in biopics?"	/r/TrueFilm/comments/1b6xwjy/oppenheimer_why_are_biopics_given_leeway_for/	https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/1b6xwjy/oppenheimer_why_are_biopics_given_leeway_for/	
barbie	TrueFilm	1p42zt7	1763842443	My now you see me, now you don’t review	"Now You See Me: Now You Do not: Made Corruption Seen

After 10 years, the therd,Now You See Me, film gets to be seen. Directed by Ruben Fleischer, with the returning cast including Jesse Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson, Dave Franco, and Isla Fisher. We also get to see a couple of fresh faces, such as: Ariana Greenblatt from Barbie.

The horsemen return with new additions to their group, to stop Veronika Vanderberg (Rosamund Pike) from taking more money than necessary from her buyers.

All the Now You See Me movies are fun to watch, due to their magic tricks and for their lighthearted fun. So far this film, has been my favorite, in the trilogy. It had action, magic tricks, and a meaningful purpose for the trick.

I feel like this movie had fewer magic tricks than the previous, however I liked it better that way. There was more time for fight scenes, like the one in the upside-down room. Having something called the upside down in a movie, so close to the last season of Stranger Things I found very amusing. However, the tricks they used to stop Vanderberg were surprising. I enjoyed   the plot with Charlie (Justice Smith,) it gave the movie a plot twist that I did not see coming. I am glad he did the right thing, even though his sister was not. I assumed the person behind all these missions was called the eye, it reminds me of the eye of Sauron , only difference is this eye is good (bummer.) these movies are good but not Lord of the Rings level good.

This film was much clearer on the purpose of what the horsemen were trying to do. In the first movie, they did a trick where they faked robbing a bank, who was stealing from the people, but the money turned out to not be there for real (it was confusing). This was straight forward, wanting to return the heart to the people, since Vanderberg was taking more money from the people, than necessary. In my opinion , it is funny that Vanderberg  had an item called the heart, when she does not have one. Someone should tell the horsemen to come to the United States (we have a ton of corruption in government.)

The more I look at a picture of Eisenberg, he looks like Harry. I do like him as an actor, he is very energetic, (if he were younger, he could have been cast for the upcoming Harry Potter reboot.)  Greenblatt was not the main character, but she did do a little more in this movie (rather than just following Barbie around.) Jack and Atlis are each other’s sidekicks, who work well, thinking up the tricks together they have good charisma, (two of my favoritee charitors.) I hope there will be another Now You See Me movie, these are fun films."	/r/TrueFilm/comments/1p42zt7/my_now_you_see_me_now_you_dont_review/	https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/1p42zt7/my_now_you_see_me_now_you_dont_review/	
barbie	TrueFilm	1jwg3ca	1744340746	I’m watching Barbie and Wow	"I watched Oppenheimer the day it released as thats what everybody decided I guess. I’m 20 now and just wow. 

I am only 8 minutes into this movie and I have understood more about woman than I have in a long time. It is honestly scary how much I learned in just 8 minutes and I’m kind of concerned about whether I’m worse than most men, or I realized it faster than the average. I am a little autistic so I wouldn’t be surprised if it wasn’t the latter. 


My point still stands, what a film, I feel everybody should watch it. It is so eye opening and I’m still baffled. I wonder what other viewers took from the film?"	/r/TrueFilm/comments/1jwg3ca/im_watching_barbie_and_wow/	https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/1jwg3ca/im_watching_barbie_and_wow/	
oppenheimer	movies	1c56z0b	1713240709	Oppenheimer - can't hear the dialogue?	"I saw Oppenheimer the other day for the first time (I know, I'm behind the curve) and it was immensely enjoyable, except for one thing small thing: 

At several points in the film, I was actively struggling to hear the dialogue being spoken on screen, with the words either sounding like inaudible mumbling, or being overwhelmed by the soundtrack being so loud that it drowned it all out. I know that Nolan's movies are filled with spectacle and engrossing soundtracks courtesy of Hans Zimmer, but it must have wound up backfiring because I literally couldn't hear the characters speaking at certain points.

I want to say this happened about 3 or 4 times - primarily in the first half of the movie - and it struck me as particularly odd because the rest of the movie went by without a hitch.

I don't know if it was my theatre who screwed up with the sound system or what, but I felt it to be particularly strange, given I have never experienced anything like this before.

Anyone else had this happen?"	/r/movies/comments/1c56z0b/oppenheimer_cant_hear_the_dialogue/	https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1c56z0b/oppenheimer_cant_hear_the_dialogue/

oppenheimer	flicks	155dteb	1689915238	I saw Oppenheimer in 70mm (non-IMAX) and honestly couldn't really tell the difference [No spoilers]	"I thought I reserved IMAX but turns out it was 70mm in a regular old theater.  I would have liked to have seen 70mm in IMAX, but by the time I found out, IMAX 70mm in my town (Los Angeles) had been sold out for like 3 weeks.

So watching it projected in 70mm on a regular screen, I honestly didn't see much difference from the current laser projection technology.  It looked REALLY GOOD, and big part of that was that this was the first showing in 70mm at the theater so the reel had next to no scratches.

But other than some flickering that my eyes adjusted to eventually, I really couldn't tell I was watching something projected on film.  It honestly felt unnecessary and more of a novelty, like getting to see some cigarette burns on the screen again.  But at the same time it didn't cost me any extra, so I'm happy I to experience the novelty.  I just don't think I'll be rushing to see any 70mm projections again anytime soon."	/r/flicks/comments/155dteb/i_saw_oppenheimer_in_70mm_nonimax_and_honestly/	https://www.reddit.com/r/flicks/comments/155dteb/i_saw_oppenheimer_in_70mm_nonimax_and_honestly/

barbie	movies	1hzcn8b	1736649039	Instances when a movie rip-offs a different movie...	"I already posted the same post into Reddit but since I didn't list the movies, this time.... I reposted it and removed the old post so here we are.

Sometimes but not all of the time, a movie comes out and is a rip-off of different movies, even ones that were successful like Avatar, Star Wars: The Force Awakens and Barbie stole ideas and plots from different movies with Avatar ripping-off from Dances with Wolves and FernGully, Force Awakens ripping-off parts from A New Hope and Barbie ripping-off parts from The LEGO Movie and UglyDolls (the latter is one that most people never heard of). And Avatar was the highest-grossing movie of 2009 and you can say the same thing about Star Wars: The Force Awakens being the highest-grossing movie of 2015 and of all-time domestically and Barbie being the highest-grossing movie of 2023 (the year we had the WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes).

However, some films rip-off more popular movies that people have seen before and there are examples that include:

The Fast &amp; The Furious (2001) is a rip-off of Point Break (1990)


The Secret Life of Pets (2016) is a rip-off of Toy Story (1995)


Mac and Me (1987) is a rip-off of E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982)


Cars (2006) is a rip-off of Doc Hollywood (1991)


Lockout (2012) is a rip-off of Escape from New York (1981)


And White House Down (2013) is a rip-off of Olympus Has Fallen (2013)

Those are the ones I can think of for now."	/r/movies/comments/1hzcn8b/instances_when_a_movie_ripoffs_a_different_movie/	https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hzcn8b/instances_when_a_movie_ripoffs_a_different_movie/

Also, how could you not know there's a giant moving bug in your hand?!

That scene always has my heart racing. I still can't believe Kate Capshaw got terrible reviews for screaming so much in the movie. It's like how do you expect a pampered Cabarey singer would react if faced with bugs or death defying stunts? She's not Marion Ravenwood who's a explorer at heart.

oppenheimer	TrueFilm	158safe	1690244989	Assemble the Pitchforks: I Hated Oppenheimer	"There's a joke in the Barbie movie where the Barbies distract the Kens by saying they've never seen the Godfather only to have it eagerly explained to them. Oppenheimer has now joined that illustrious list of films. My roommate who is a history geek was trying to fill in all the gaps for me and explain what the film was doing. History aside, I got what it was doing but I found it overly pretentious. I'm not a Nolan hater but I am also certainly not a fan and have only seen a few of his films. I've seen the Batman Begins, The Dark Knight Rises and Inception with chunks of The Dark Knight and Interstellar. I tried watching Dunkirk but fell asleep. I've never seen any of his films more than one except maybe Inception because I think I watched it on a plane once. I liked those movies fine but I felt no need to rewatch. I could watch The Departed on a 24 hour loop but I can't even really tell you what happens in Batman Begins. So perhaps a lot of the things I'm gonna bring up are just his style. I did not like this film very much at all. I went into this relatively blind outside of the memes so I was genuinely expecting something a bit more enthralling, for lack of a better word. But I also was somewhat familiar with the history of the Manhattan project and I wasn't quite sure how this film was gonna work if they didn't show the bombing of Japan. I was certain they wouldn't, mostly because I didn't see any Asian actors mentioned among this certifiable cast of thousands, and also because I don't feel like it would've been in good taste. Nolan apparently had the same thought and I'm glad because we did not need to see this recreated to get the point about the destructiveness of the bomb. You can Google the Hiroshima and Nagasaki Bombings if you really want a visceral look at what happened there. But it's exclusion did make me wonder how they were gonna string audiences along for this ride for three hours. 

Oppenheimer is appropriately named because the film has much less to do with the bomb itself than the man behind it's creation. I don't know if J Robert Oppenheimer is that interesting of a person in and of himself to warrant a three hour historical epic about him but Christopher Nolan certainly does. When they are discussing anything scientific or related to the task at how, I felt like they were speaking in code. I'm not saying that the geek speak threw me off, I was actually surprised by how little of it there was. A character runs into the scene holding up a piece of paper we are told is important because it's about cracking some science thing. The characters then spend an inoordinate amount of minutes discussing the importance of what's on the paper rather than what it actually means. There's a lot of this vagueness which I believe was done to make what these people were doing feel more weighted and given the appropriate heft it has in history. However this resulted in all the characters and the first forty minutes of the film feeling like a trailer for the movie instead of a movie itself. I kept waiting for the film to start in a sense. I don't know if this is just a stylistic thing Nolan does but some of the dialogue almost felt like it was meant to be bad. When Oppenheimer says 'goddamn it I love this country' I laughed assuming that was a gag line. The characters talked like they were in a Joss Whedon film. None of the dialogue felt natural or organic. It very much felt like Nolan wanted you to feel the magnitude and weight of what the film is centered around. But oddly enough, they never get into the actual nitty gritty details of what that is. 'Is gonna destroy the world?' is really about as much as we get. The film is relying upon you knowing the history of what comes next so it remained kinda cryptic. I actually was wondering for a while if this was going to do an alternate history thing towards the end but it felt like they were building to something that felt a lot more grandiose than what we got, or at least it was presented. 

A major folly in the writing here is that there are too many characters. Nolan was determined not to condense real life figures into fictional ones for brevity but I think he should've. There are so many characters whose introductions are barely highlighted but they become instrumental later on. Rami Malek's character is actually pretty damn important in the end but I'll be damned if I could tell you his name. I don't even think it was mentioned until he pops up again when he is actually affecting the plot. Benny Safdie's character simply arrives in the film. I was not texting at all in this film and the edibles I took had me viscerally aware of every damn scene in this movie. When he popped up about halfway in I audibly asked 'who the hell is that?' There's a lot of that in this movie. I don't think we needed this many named and speaking characters because after a while I got lost following who was important in what way and how certain characters related to the task at hand. I think if you cut and condense a lot of these characters, the narrative becomes much smoother and also gives the story more time to breathe. But what about how all of these various characters are portrayed? Because there were so many I honestly had a hard time keeping up with names and who was who. This was aided by their characterizations not being very strong. A few supporting characters stood out mostly because of their actor's notoriety. But a slew of other characters got lost in the shuffle. If you cut down on characters it gives you a lot more time to flesh out the characters who are meant to stand out more, namely the women. 

It is apparently a given that Christopher Nolan struggles to write women. I have not seen enough of his work to make that assessment but I can say that the women felt very superfluous here. It was definitely an experience going from the feel good feminine energy of Barbie to Oppenheimer where the women serve as emotional props to the men. Jean Tatlock gets the worst of it. I had no idea how this woman mattered to Oppenheimer outside of being a former lover. According to my partner and Wikipedia, she was a lot more than just that to them. The actual film gives us no context to why she matters especially since his association with her is apparently something even Robert Downey Jr's character is aware of. I kept waiting for them to reveal her to be a Russian spy or something. Maybe I just miss Florence Pugh playing Yelena, a character surprisingly more fleshed out than what she's given her. She exists in this film to show us her breasts, give us an incredibly uncomfortable scene in a meeting room and set up for the most uncomfortable introduction of what would become Oppenheimer's catchphrase of sorts. Emily Blunt's character doesn't fair much better. Nolan took Florence Pugh who is so skilled at playing nuanced complicated women and slapped her in a horrendous wig and stripped her naked. He took Emily Blunt who has some insane versatility and had her play the scorned and angry alcoholic wife. But her role in the film doesn't make a ton of sense. Her early scenes establish pretty early on she's a hard drinker and has some emotional issues. Her anger is purely focused on Oppenheimer for reasons probably relating to Tatlock. Then she kinda shifts midway into being angry at the system and is giving motivational speeches and it's jarring. She's never portrayed as anything but 'the wife' so when she displays a lot more cunning and wit later on, it's welcomed but I also kept saying 'where did this come from? ' I don't feel as if the film portrayed Kitty in a way that did justice to her. I get that it's about her husband, not her but for as little as she and honestly Jean contributed to the actual story they could've been cut. Oppenheimer actually has a third woman whose name I cannot remember and she doesn't affect the story in any material way I can think of.

I do get that playing with time and perception is kinda Nolan's thing. I've only seen him actually do this in Inception and what I've seen of Interstellar since the Batman movies don't do a ton of that. I think that type of thing works better in movies with more fantastical premises, at least for him. Because here it didn't really do much for me. I would've much preferred if this had been more of a straight forward narrative about the creation of the atomic bomb and dropping in bits and pieces of Oppenheimer's personal life when you need to. The story they were telling about the Manhattan project was/is infinitely interesting on it's own. I didn't need to bounce back between various points in time, mostly because it was unclear when things were happening and dampered by ability to follow along, nor did I need certain segments in black and white. I somewhat understand the artistic reasoning for this but it kept having me think that these scenes were further back in time than they were. Functionally, I think they help separate the clearance stuff and the building the bomb stuff. But honestly you don't lose much if those scenes are in color. A lot of the stylistic choices seemed to be there to make up for a lack of substance. At first, I thought the hearing scenes and the clearance scenes were meant to be much more important than they were. I thought the hearing was about something more weighty than a cabinet confirmation and I thought the clearance scenes were a deposition of sorts. When they got to be revealed for what they are as the film trotted along, I felt let down. Nolan is putting together the elements of a political thriller/drama like Three Days of Condor, All the President's Men, Mr. Smith Goes to Washington and the like but there's nothing at the core of this to justify these trappings. The creation of the atomic bomb and what it means for international relations is a deep topic but Nolan doesn't seem interested in actually discussing it or anchoring it into the story in a meaningful way. Characters talk around the topic but never really sit down and discuss the implications of what they're doing. This felt like dialogue for a cape flick, not a political thriller. I understand what Nolan was going for in that the scientists were so preoccupied by if they could rather than if they should. They assumed they'd have control over how and when and why this was used. If this was more thoroughly explored within character moments I think I would've enjoyed this film more. This film is almost entirely composed of people talking but despite that I don't feel like they said much. I can't really recall any of the dialogue or notable lines in this film outside of a couple of Blunt's towards the end. 

As slipshod as the script was, the editing was absolutely horrendous for me. Please tell me if this is just his style but it felt like there was a cut every five seconds. I've made short films, I've done indies. I get that making a non action film interesting can be hard. But maybe if you're having a hard time making Boring Conversation No. 17 interesting to watch onscreen you might wanna cut that scene. There was so much telling and very little showing which is surprising for a film that honestly should be quite showy. I almost would've preferred more Sorkinesque walk talking than the barrage of cuts we got in every single conversation that took place in this film. Nolan wants you to feel the weight and importance of these men and what they're doing. There's lots of tight close ups, lots of wordless shots just taking them in, lots of extended reaction shots etc. I don't mind these in a vacuum but I do have a problem when they are repeated ad nauseam. There are some visual elements I actually liked. The color saturation and red lighting during any scenes that had multiple communists was a nice touch. Kitty seeing Oppenheimer describe his affair with Jean while seeing Jean riding his dick was a welcome visual trick. It's not that I wanna see Florence Pugh getting bred by The Scarecrow but broke up the monotony of those clearance scenes in a much needed way. The cheering turned to shrieking turned to bodies burning to dust was also a good scene. The way the crying/cheering was played so ambiguously as to what the emotion being portrayed was is something I really liked. I would've liked a lot more emphasis on how Oppenheimer came to the position he did about the bomb than rather a couple short scenes. The entire last third of the movie should've just been that but instead we are now getting the most milquetoast of political dramas. I also really wanted more emphasis on the ethnic and religious backgrounds of many of the scientists doing this work, including the man himself. Yes it's brought up from time to time and it's not entirely lost on men why these brilliant minds would get involved. But maybe give us some scenes of our Jewish characters just hanging out and being themselves. Then juxtapose that with the severity of the war and Hitler's actions and show what's at stake. You don't need to show a concentration camp but you could get creative with how you relay this information to the characters and the audience. I think also from a 'we need to know who these people are' standpoint they needed a scene similar to the party from Age of Ultron. Give us an organic way to see how all of these personalities interact outside of work and maybe give them character traits. Make some up if they were boring in real life. Because there's a lot of similar looking dark haired white men in suits in this movie and they blended together after a while. 

The first hour and a half felt like build up and I was forgiving of all of the sloppy writing, nonexistent characterization for the most part and annoying editing choices because I knew we were gonna see a bomb drop. I knew it wasn't Hiroshima or Nagasaki because again that would've been in EXTREMELY poor taste and honestly the Japanese have offered much better and personal versions of that side of the story. I was expecting to be blown away by the technical prowess displayed in the Trinity Test. I felt like the random flames they kept cutting to were more visually appealing than the actual explosion. I think it was competently done but neither the actual explosion or the awestruck scene around it really did much for me. This is where I was expecting the sound to knock me off my feet too. He oddly didn't do a lot with this scene I haven't seen done before or better. Michael Bay has delivered more awe inspiring explosions. I get that he didn't want to rely on computer effects but I was not moved as much as I should've been by this. Somehow, there was about forty minutes left of movie after this. Everything after the Trinity Test dragged on horribly and not even the spastic editing could save it. 

I thought most of the acting in this was fine. The script didn't give them really anything to work with. Robert Downey Jr is doing a great job but he's basically giving me older Tony Stark and that's not a dig. He was easily the most entertaining performance in the film and while I cannot recite a word of any of his long ass congressional speeches, I can say that I felt like he performed them well. Matt Damon was fine. Emily Blunt did her best. Florence Pugh was given nothing to work with but did okay. Gary Oldman was the second best performance in the film. Cillian Murphy is clearly trying very hard to give this character some edge and life but I'm sorry I hated the main character. Murphy is doing everything he can to give Oppenheimer some bite but the writing for this character does not do him any favors. He's bland and unnerving yet everyone somehow loves and respects him. He's not very engaging of a personality but in-universe they're acting like he's this wild card who can't be trusted. He's framed as this leader type who can convince the unconvinceable but he's not shown to have any good people skills. Murphy is playing him somewhere in between Johnny Depp's Willy Wonka and Rain Man. I really did not enjoy this performance and we are stuck with him for three hours. I did not love the voice he used and at times I couldn't understand certain things he was saying. Thankfully, my screening was captioned. Everyone else in the movie is okay. They were doing good work they just didn't have a good script. 

I just don't think this film was for me. I feel like you could've cut this down to a breezy two hours because the story they were focused on telling did not warrant a three hour runtime. The actors outside of the lead were fine and the production value was solid. But despite this important topic I walked away not feeling like anything of importance at all had been communicated. I think if you're into Christopher Nolan's style this is going to be a good watch for you. My partner gave it a 7/10. Unfortunately my opinion is much lower and I'll give it a 3/10. Nolan should be thanking his lucky stars Barbenheimer became a thing because this movie doesn't get as many eyeballs as it does without it. There are definitely going to be people who enjoy this more than I do. But if you're planning on seeing this just for the meme, either take a few edibles like I did or wait til streaming.

And now for some assorted thoughts: 

-I get that the film is called Oppenheimer but seeing as every white man who apparently had a role on this project showed up, maybe a couple of scenes showing some of the Black, Asian and Latino scientists who also worked on the Manhattan project would've been nice. A Black character pops up here and there and I was expecting him to be revealed as someone important, there were several Black scientists working on this bomb back then. Nope, he doesn't even get a line. Maybe some of that time spent in various hearings could deal with how the government screwed over Hispanic and Indigenous communities in the building of Los Alamos. Maybe some of the Hispanics who worked with the hazardous materials and got cancer as a result warranted one or two scenes. Almost none of this is brought up. 

-Would they have really called it World War 2 back then? That feels out of place. The dialogue felt like it wanted to be snappy but didn't know how. He wrote this like it's a superhero movie. There's even a suit up scene which was ridiculous. Like are we supposed to be so familiar with his personal style and we're like 'oh shit he got the hat!'

-As much as this film wasn't for me, the first hour or so did move along nicely. It never spent enough time on one scene to actually wear out it's welcome, at first. It moves like a blockbuster which I will admit is a feat for a film with zero action scenes."	/r/TrueFilm/comments/158safe/assemble_the_pitchforks_i_hated_oppenheimer/	https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/158safe/assemble_the_pitchforks_i_hated_oppenheimer/	
mi7	movies	1litmsa	1750715578	June 20-22 Box Office Recap – 'How to Train Your Dragon' stays #1, but drops a rough 57% on its second weekend. '28 Years Later' debuts with a pretty good $30M domestically and $60M worldwide. However, 'Elio' flops with a terrible $20M domestically and $34M worldwide, the worst debut for Pixar.	"https://preview.redd.it/q8ew8lqszq8f1.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fcd1ac805e410d7cad93ff5c9d24d372f3f22acc

It was a mixed bag at the box office this weekend.

Unsurprisingly, the ***How to Train Your Dragon*** live-action stayed at the top of the box office, although it still had a rough drop. ***28 Years Later*** achieved a very solid #2 start, although it remains to be seen if it will have legs.

However, the weekend is also defined by some very bad news. That's the case with Pixar's ***Elio***, which flopped this weekend and posted the studio's worst debut in all its 30 years of history.

The Top 10 earned a combined $120.6 million this weekend. That's down 18.6% from last year, when ***Inside Out 2*** repeated at #1.

Staying at the top spot, Universal/DreamWorks' ***How to Train Your Dragon*** added $36.5 million this weekend. That's a very bad 57% drop, which is steeper than any of the animated films and quite poor for a family film. Despite its strong weekdays, it looks like the film might have had a ceiling regardless of its strong word of mouth.

Through 10 days, the film has earned $160 million, just slightly short of outgrossing ***The Hidden World***'s $160.7 million total. In the next few days, it will pass the second film ($177 million). Although this drop suggests that it might not be as leggy as its weekdays suggested.

In second place, Sony's ***28 Years Later*** debuted with a pretty good $30 million in 3,444 theaters. That's easily the best debut in the franchise, tripling both ***Days*** ($10 million) and ***Weeks*** ($9.8 million). It's also the biggest debut for director Danny Boyle.

All in all, this is a pretty great debut. After all, the original franchise had a ceiling at the box office, but it has built an audience across home media, streaming and cable reruns. While there were projections that could go as high as $40 million, it's not really a bad start. This proves the franchise's popularity; if it wasn't, the film wouldn't have hit $30 million on its opening weekend.

Credit must go to Sony's incredible job in marketing the film. That teaser, accompanied with the 1903 poem ""Boots"" by Rudyard Kipling, was fantastic and even became the seccond biggest horror film trailer of all time back then (***Final Destination: Bloodlines*** would later claim this title). Obviously, it wasn't gonna open as high as the ***It*** films, but that clearly showed interest. Cinephiles were also excited to see the return of Danny Boyle and Alex Garland as director and writer, respectively. And without many horror options right now, this was a perfect date. And they also delivered a fantastic film; it's currently sitting at a 89% on RT.

Despite its great debut, it has to be noted that the film was quite front-loaded. Thursday previews ($5.8 million) accounted for 19.3% of its weekend gross, which is very high, even for horror (for reference, ***Final Destination: Bloodlines***' previews were just 10.6% of its weekend gross). It was followed by a steep 37% drop on Friday-to-Saturday, when horrors drop 25% at most. This suggests that the film might be more fan-driven than expected.

According to Sony, 61% of the audience was male. Horror usually leans young, but that's not the case here; only 25% of the audience was 25 and under. They gave it a solid ""B"" on CinemaScore, which is not bad for a horror film. There's some online chatter about the film's ending, which drew some polarized reactions. With ***M3GAN 2.0*** and ***I Know What You Did Last Summer*** on the way, perhaps the film won't hold very well. But it should still have enough gas to hit $75 million domestically. And now it's all up to ***The Bone Temple*** to keep this winning streak in January.

Debuting in third place, Disney/Pixar's ***Elio*** flopped with a very terrible $20.8 million in 3,750 theaters. This is the absolute worst debut in Pixar's history, far below both ***Elemental*** and the original ***Toy Story*** (both at $29 million). And this is all unadjusted, which makes it even worse!

The road to ***Elio*** was always going to be tricky. In the past few years, there have been a lot of sci-fi animated films that failed to find success at the box office: ***Lightyear***, ***Strange World*** and ***Transformers One***. It doesn't help when it's a non-IP film, as those films have been struggling to gain traction in the post-COVID climate (***Sinners*** is a big exception, not the rule). And with a $150 million, it's safe to deem this as a flop.

What didn't help ***Elio*** was its delays. This film was supposed to come out in March 2024, but it was delayed to this current date. And in the full year, the film's concept was retooled, which is why you see a big difference from the original teaser to the most recent trailers. But by delaying the film, perhaps the audience lost interest in the film. If they were gonna spend money at theaters, they probably would go for a more familiar IP. In this case, releasing it the week after ***How to Train Your Dragon*** was a death sentence. And the marketing just wasn't really efficient; it couldn't overcome the ""been there, done that"" feeling from other films. Even with some good reviews (83% on RT), it simply failed to grab audiences.

According to Disney, 59% of the audience was male. In an interesting stat, 39% of the audience was 12 and under, a skew far younger than usual for Pixar (last year, ***Inside Out*** had 20% at 12 and under).

Okay, so it's a bad debut. But not everything is hopeless. Audiences gave ***Elio*** a strong ""A"" on CinemaScore, which could bode well for legs. ***Elemental*** opened with a poor $29 million, but strong word of mouth allowed it to reach $154 million domestically. It remains to be seen if ***Elio*** can have strong legs; the only animated competition is ***Smurfs*** in mid July. But even if it had ***Elemental***'s legs, that would still be just $108 million domestically. Barring a miracle, ***Elio*** is pretty much guaranteed to become Pixar's lowest grossing film at the domestic box office (***Onward*** technically made $60 million, but it had to close early due to COVID shutdowns, so it doesn't really count). What will Pixar do now?

After its rough drops for the past weeks, ***Lilo &amp; Stitch*** appears to be stabilizing. It dipped 38%, adding $9.7 million. That takes its domestic total to $386.7 million, and it's on course to finish with around $415 million domestically.

In fifth place, ***Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning*** dipped 39% and grossed $6.4 million. With $178.2 million domestically, it has surpassed the domestic lifetime of ***Dead Reckoning*** ($172 million). It will finish with over $190 million, but the $200 million dream is dead.

In sixth place, A24's ***Materialists*** added $5.8 million this weekend. That's a 49% drop, which is quite solid, considering its weak ""B–"" on CinemaScore suggested it could face some problems. Through 10 days, the film has amassed $23.2 million, and it should close with almost $35 million domestically.

***Karate Kid: Legends*** is on its way out of theaters. It dropped 55%, earning just $2.3 million. The film has earned a disappointing $49.3 million so far.

***Ballerina*** is also nearing the end of its run in theaters. It dropped 54% this weekend, earning $4.5 million. The film has made $51 million, and it's set to become the least attended film in the series.

In ninth place, ***Final Destination: Bloodlines*** dropped 53%, adding $1.8 million. The film has earned $134.8 million so far.

Rounding out the Top 10 was the Indian film ***Kuberaa***, which managed to earn $1.7 million in 500 theaters.

It doesn't look like Neon's ***The Life of Chuck*** will last much more longer in theaters, not only after its weak debut but also its weak second weekend drop. The film dropped a poor 57%, earning just $1 million. Through 10 days in wide release, the film has made just $4.6 million domestically. If you want to check this film out, you better do it as soon as possible, cause it's about to disappear.

#**OVERSEAS**

***How to Train Your Dragon*** led the overseas box office with $53.6 million, for a $357.7 million worldwide total. The film's best markets are Mexico ($24.5M), China ($23.2M), UK ($16.8M), Brazil ($12.6M) and Korea ($9.6M). Easily set for over $600 million worldwide.

***28 Years Later*** also had a good start outside America. It earned $30 million overseas for a $60 million worldwide debut. It had pretty good debuts in the UK ($6.4M) and Mexico ($2.7M), followed by more modest starts in Australia ($1.7M), Korea ($1.5M), Germany ($1.3M), France ($1.3M) and Spain ($1.2M). Let's see how it holds in the coming weeks.

***Lilo &amp; Stitch*** added $19.7 million overseas, for a $910 million worldwide total. Its best markets are Mexico ($64.2M), UK ($46.3M), France ($37.1M), Brazil ($34.5M) and Germany ($29M).

You thought the domestic numbers for ***Elio*** were depressing? Wait till you see the worldwide numbers. It debuted with an abysmal $14 million overseas, for a poor $34.8 million worldwide debut. It had very weak debuts in South Korea ($1.8M), Mexico ($1.4M), France ($1.3M), UK ($1.2M) and Italy ($800K). In most of these markets, it lost to ***28 Years Later*** and posted the worst Pixar debut as well. There's still a few markets left, but this is still a very horrible way to kick off its run. The film needs over $350 million just to recoup its investment, which means it must do over 10 times this weekend's performance to get there. Unless a miracle happens, it's a flop.

***Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning*** added $12.8 million overseas, taking its worldwide total to $540.7 million. The best markets are China ($60.6M), UK ($32.9M), Japan ($30.2M), Korea ($22.5M) and France ($21.8M). 

With $49.7 million overseas, ***Ballerina*** has now crossed $100 million. But that's still nowhere close to being considered a remotely passable number.

#**FILMS THAT ENDED THEIR RUN THIS WEEK**

None.

#**THIS WEEKEND**

We've got two wide releases, but one is clearly going for the #1 finish.

And that's Warner Bros./Apple's ***F1***, which stars Brad Pitt as a F1 driver who comes out of retirement to mentor a new prodigy. Formula One is incredibly popular in Europe, and its popularity has also picked up some steam in America thanks to the Netflix documentary series ***Drive to Survive***. Apple hasn't had much luck with their theatrical releases so far, and currently, ***F1*** is their only theatrical project lined up (***Highest 2 Lowest*** technically is going into theaters but it's a 2-week limited release, so it hardly counts). The project cost $200 million (not the $300 million figure everyone talked about months ago) and both Apple and WB have pulled a very extensive marketing campaign. Surely the foreign markets will be strong, but America also needs to show up. Will this be Apple's first hit at the box office?

The other release is Universal/Blumhouse's ***M3GAN 2.0***, the sequel to the 2023 phenomenon. Instead of taking the similar route that horror sequels have pulled (the exact same premise), the sequel chose to go bonkers instead. Instead of doing another ""AI doll who kills people"", the film is going the full ""AI doll vs. AI doll"" angle and accepting how stupid and ridiculous this situation is. But is that an advantage or will it be its biggest weakness?

Hey guys! I love doing projects like this just for fun. I love rating and ranking movies and doing brackets. It's a real sweet spot for me. I had this idea the other day so I figured I should pursue it. How this came to be was that I took a look at the most popular movies on Letterboxd, then I split them up into the 8 genres you see above. The seeds were simply determined by how high they were on Letterboxd's popularity list. There was a little bit of fudging with the genres just to make everything fit, but I don't believe there is anything egregiously out of place. For those who want to see all of the seeds broken down, here they are...

I kept debating, do I run to the bathroom and miss a big part of the movie, or do I hold it and be uncomfortable for the next hour?

That’s when I thought: what if theaters had a small add-on feature where you could use your phone for a short, one-time “bathroom break” stream (like 5 minutes max) that picks up exactly where you left off in the theater? You could just use it while you’re out of the room, then it cuts off when you get back.

It could be something that’s part of the theater’s app or even included in their memberships, or maybe like a $1 add-on when buying your ticket.

I know it might sound random, but I feel like people who drink soda or watch long movies (like Oppenheimer or Dune 2) would actually use it.

Do you think people would be into this or would it ruin the whole “theater experience”?"	/r/movies/comments/1o1nxlf/be_honest_would_you_use_a_bathroom_break_feature/	https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1o1nxlf/be_honest_would_you_use_a_bathroom_break_feature/

oppenheimer	movies	1kzrdis	1748676737	I wish more major Directors worked with the Anthology or Short Film format	"In general I feel like the Short Film or larger Anthology as a format remains very underutilized and seems to be used only by indie filmmakers as Demo Reels to sell their potential to studios, and not as a perfectly valid and useful form of storytelling.

Imagine if Tarantino still high on his **TEN FILMS AND IM DONE** self imposed rule final film was an Anthology where he could combine every lose half baked idea into one. Kill Bill Vol 3! the now old Vega Brothers! something vaguely Star Trek! The Critic! some random Horror stuff! just a 3+ hour collection of Shorts to end his career on. He could get every actor he wants without them committing to a long shoot. Ideally without too much marketing so these would all be secret for at least a couple hours.

or if today Nolan in between Oppenheimer and The Odyssey just released a lighthearted and goofy detective short with *insert A+ List Actor* that didn't have to deal with the weight of being an Oppenheimer Followup and was just a small project to get out some random ideas and test out a new camera.

While I personally didn't love last years Kinds of Kindness I found it to be a perfect experiment for Yorgos to get his current gang together and try out some ideas that wouldn't work as full features, and it was fun. Similarly Wes Andersons recent Dahl adaptations on Netflix also feel like a perfect format to follow and yet no one else seems to be interested.

so what do you think? What Directors Anthology film would you like to see?

mi7	movies	1ld74m5	1750113882	June 13-15 Box Office Recap – 'How to Train Your Dragon' flies to a fantastic $198M worldwide debut, the best in the franchise. 'Materialists' opens with $11.3M, the third best debut in A24's history. However, Neon's 'The Life of Chuck' disappoints with just $2.3M.	"https://preview.redd.it/ec6bwbl0bd7f1.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e2de910277562c1266263fbfcfc38cb837a209ce

Turns out audiences were also welcome to DreamWorks remaking their own films.

The live-action remake of ***How to Train Your Dragon*** easily topped the box office, opening higher than any of the prior films. A24 also found success with ***Materialists***, which scored the company's third best debut. Unfortunately, the week's big loser was Neon's ***The Life of Chuck***, which disappointed in its wide expansion.

The Top 10 earned a combined $146.4 million this weekend. That's down a rough 30.6% from last year, when ***Inside Out 2*** debuted with a colossal $154 million.

Opening at #1, ***How to Train Your Dragon*** debuted with a pretty great $84.6 million in 4,356 theaters. That's higher than any of the animated films, even adjusted for inflation. Obviously below ***Lilo &amp; Stitch***'s massive debut, but the film was not really expected to come close to those numbers.

There were concerns over the idea of a live-action remake of this franchise. After all, the original film is barely 15 years old and fresh in people's mind. But it's clear that it was enough nostalgia to make people curious. Universal and DreamWorks made two great jobs here: getting Dean DeBlois back as the director with complete control, and re-capture the iconic images of the animated film. Sure, it leaned as shot-for-shot in some aspects, but clearly it worked here. As the saying goes, ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it.""

According to Universal, 56% of the audience was female, and 68% was 35 and under. They gave it a strong ""A"" on CinemaScore, the same grade as the animated films. Even with ***Elio*** coming up, this should be a main attraction for families throughout the summer. It should definitely hit over $250 million domestically. Universal ain't wasting a second with this, as they already set a sequel for June 2027.

In second place, ***Lilo &amp; Stitch*** dropped 51.4% and added $15.7 million this weekend. That's not a terrible drop, but it's still quite rough. For the past few weeks, the film has had very mediocre legs at the box office. For some perspective, its first weekend was $82 million ahead of ***Mission: Impossible***. Now it's fourth weekend is just $5 million ahead. The film has amassed $366.5 million domestically, and it's now guaranteed to finish below ***A Minecraft Movie*** ($423 million). Quite front-loaded for a family film.

In third place, A24's ***Materialists*** opened with $11.3 million this weekend. While Box Office Mojo and The Numbers report the debut at $12 million, Deadline said that the updated actuals are $11.3 million. That's the studio's third biggest debut ever, behind ***Civil War*** ($25.5 million) and ***Hereditary*** ($13.5 million). Notably, it matched the domestic lifetime of Celine Song's previous film, ***Past Lives*** ($11.3 million), in just 3 days.

This debut suggests that there's still an audience waiting for a romance in theaters. A24 sold the film pretty much solely on its cast. Sure, Dakota Johnson, Chris Evans and Pedro Pascal have had some box office duds in the past few years, but they're still well known names. Celine Song has also earned a cult following thanks to her critically acclaimed ***Past Lives***. While ***Materialists*** didn't have the universal acclaim of that film, it still earned a great response (86% on RT). 

According to A24, 74% of the audience was female and 69% was 35 and under. This is a great debut... but here's when things turn a little wild. Audiences gave the film a very weak ""B–"" on CinemaScore, which is quite poor for a romance film. It's a result of A24 marketing the film as a traditional rom-com, but the final film is not that. It's quite likely that the film falls off in coming weeks, but it should still hit $30 million domestically.

Even with the loss of IMAX screens, ***Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning*** had its best drop so far. It dipped just 28.8%, adding $10.5 million this weekend. While the film started $14 million behind ***Dead Reckoning*** on its opening weekend, it's now $15 million ahead of it through the same point. The film has earned $166.5 million, and it will outgross that film's domestic total in the next few days.

After its disappointing debut last week, ***Ballerina*** didn't save face on its second weekend. It collapsed 60.2%, earning just $9.7 million this weekend. That drop is slightly better than ***John Wick: Chapter 4*** (62%), but that film's opening weekend was 3 times larger. Even with positive reviews and word of mouth, it doesn't appear like the audience was much interested in this.

Through 10 days, ***Ballerina*** has earned just $42.1 million domestically. If it keeps dropping like this, it will miss $60 million domestically. So there's a strong chance that it becomes the least attended film in the franchise (***John Wick***'s adjusted total is $58.4 million). Ouch.

***Karate Kid: Legends*** recovered after its terrible drop last week. It dipped 38.7%, adding $5.2 million this weekend. Although the film's $44.4 million domestic total still leaves a lot to be desired.

In seventh place, ***Final Destination: Bloodlines*** eased 37.9% and earned $4 million. The film has amassed $130.7 million domestically, and it will finish with close to $140 million. Assuming it's not fully impacted by ***28 Years Later*** this week.

Wes Anderson's ***The Phoenician Scheme*** dropped 48.9% and added $3.2 million. That's actually a better drop than ***Asteroid City*** (53%). Impressive, considering the film's word of mouth wasn't as strong as that film. Through 2 weekends in wide release, the film has earned $12.9 million.

Neon expanded Mike Flanagan's ***The Life of Chuck*** to 1,072 theaters, but the film disappointed in ninth place with just $2.3 million this weekend. That's Flanagan's worst debut in theaters; his three theatrical films all managed to open with at least $12 million. Sure, they all opened in far more theaters, but still.

Unfortunately, this result isn't surprising. After all, the limited release last week was underwhelming, indicating it wasn't going to break out in its expansion. The film earned buzz when it surprisingly won the People's Choice Award at the Toronto Film Festival, suggesting it would be an awards player. Instead of cashing in on the buzz, Neon bought it and decided to set it for summer. In a sea of competition, it simply feels like the buzz died down in the past 9 months. It just didn't connect with audiences.

Due to releasing in just 1,072 theaters, we don't have much data breakdown for the weekend. Now, the audience reception is very positive, which bodes well for its legs. Although with a debut this low (and little-to-no awards buzz), the film might not last long in theaters.

Rounding out the Top 10 was ***Sinners***, which dropped 45.8% for a $1.5 million weekend. The film has earned an incredible $275.5 million so far.

A24's ***Bring Her Back*** is disappearing quickly. It collapsed 60%, adding $1.4 million this weekend. The film's domestic total stands at $17.6 million.

***Thunderbolts*** is also nearing the end of its run. It collapsed 57.7%, earning just $1 million this weekend. The film has earned $188.5 million, and it will finish its run with around $192 million.

#**OVERSEAS**

***How to Train Your Dragon*** also led the box office in the rest of the world. It opened with a fantastic $114.1 million overseas, for a $198 million worldwide debut. The best debuts were in Mexico ($14M), the UK ($11.4M), China ($11.2M), Brazil ($7.8M), South Korea ($7.4M), France ($5.1M), Australia ($4.4M), Spain ($4.3M), Germany ($4M) and Italy ($3.3M). Nearly all of these markets are all franchise best. Like the domestic market, this should be the main attraction for families for the summer. The second film is the highest grossing in the franchise with $621 million worldwide, and the remake should easily fly past that. Expect more live-action DreamWorks remakes. For better or worse.

***Lilo &amp; Stitch*** was impacted by ***Dragon***'s arrival. It dropped 54% and added $31 million this weekend, for a $858 million worldwide total. The best markets are Mexico ($61.8M), UK ($45.1M), France ($35.2M), Brazil ($31.8M) and Germany ($27M). While the film seemed like an ""easy billion"" based on its opening weekend, these drops are quite steeper than expected, and it has no new markets left to open. For now, $1 billion is still in the cards, but if it hits it, it won't be by much.

***Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning*** added $21 million overseas, allowing it to cross $500 million worldwide. The best markets are China ($55.8M), UK ($31.2M), Japan ($27.3M), Korea ($21.6M) and France ($20.8M). It should pass ***Dead Reckoning*** worldwide, but it still remains to be seen if it will touch $600 million.

***Ballerina*** added $13.5 million overseas, taking its worldwide total to $91 million. Barring a miracle recovery, the film will probably close with around $140 million worldwide. Damn.

#**FILMS THAT ENDED THEIR RUN THIS WEEK**

Movie | Release Date | Studio | Domestic Opening | Domestic Total | Worldwide Total | Budget |
----------|----------|----------|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:
*The Amateur* | Apr/11 | 20th Century Studios | $14,802,849 | $40,759,635 | $95,956,038 | $60M
*The Accountant 2* | Apr/25 | Amazon MGM | $24,533,959 | $65,523,366 | $102,123,366 | $80M

- ***The Amateur*** has closed with almost $96 million worldwide. Not a bad amount, although its $60 million budget put profitability quite high. While it started with some promise, it didn't really hold well in the coming weeks. There's potential in mid-budget thrillers, but the quality still needs to be there if it wants a chance at success.

- But you know what not many expected? That ***The Accountant 2*** would finish with $102 million worldwide, barely above ***The Amateur***. That's a rough drop from the original's $155 million worldwide total, but it simply looks like the audience moved on after 9 years. Even when the original was a huge hit in home media and streaming. A sequel is in development, but it's more likely it will go to Prime Video instead.

#**THIS WEEKEND**

We've got two wide releases. One will contend for the #1 spot, and the other is probably heading to some very ugly numbers.

After so many years stuck in development in hell, Sony is finally releasing Danny Boyle's ***28 Years Later***, 18 years after the latest installment in the franchise. Like the previous films, there are no returning cast members, with Jodie Comer, Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Ralph Fiennes as the new leads. But what's important is the return of Boyle in the director's chair, alongside Alex Garland as the screenwriter. The film is also setting a higher bar than most horror films; it cost $75 million, more expensive than the average horror film. It's also set to launch a trilogy, with the second film already filmed and set for January 2026. How big will it be?

The other release is Pixar's ***Elio***, the company's 29th film. It follows an eleven-year-old boy named Elio who accidentally becomes the intergalactic ambassador of planet Earth after being beamed up to the Communiverse by aliens for making contact. The film has had a complicated release, given that it was supposed to come out in March 2024. And in the process, some aspects of the film were retooled, including replacing America Ferrera with Zoe Saldana. While Pixar hit gold last year with ***Inside Out 2***, there's no chance ***Elio*** opens anywhere close to that. The recent failure of other sci-fi animated films like ***Lightyear***, ***Strange World***, and ***Transformers One*** puts a lot more pressure on this film.

indiana_jones	flicks	1gmunda	1731104024	"Why is, ""Indiana Jones"" not a very beloved franchise?"	"In 1981, Steven Spielberg and George Lucas (known for their previous work on, ""Jaws"", and ""Star Wars"", respectively) made the film, ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"". It follows the story of Indiana Jones, part-time college professor, part-time adventure hunter, as he tries to obtain a mythical artifact before the Nazis beat him to it.

This was followed by a prequel and several sequels.

I think this is a really good movie franchise with a great spirit of adventure, an impeccable score, and a memorable lead character.

So I was wondering, why is this movie not very much beloved?

We see that other films made by Lucas and Spielberg, like E.T., Star Wars, Jaws, or the Empire Stikes Back, have achieved that status. So why hasn't that been the case for Indiana Jones?

oppenheimer	TrueFilm	15cao1e	1690581910	After a rewatch, Oppenheimer is unquestionably Nolan’s best film	"I saw Oppenheimer for the first time last weekend in 70mm IMAX, and while it was a great experience, I was initially overwhelmed by the spectacle of it all and only tentatively put it in his top 5 (The Prestige, Dunkirk, Memento, TDK being the other 4).

But after watching it for the second time a couple nights ago and digesting it again for a day, I concluded it is without a doubt his greatest achievement. Almost every issue I had with it initially (mainly pacing and editing) went away after a rewatch and it flowed seamlessly. 

I’ve also seen others say they were “underwhelmed” by the Trinity explosion, which admittedly was my first reaction as well, but I loved everything about it the second go around. Lynch already used CGI brilliantly in Twin Peaks to showcase the Trinity Test and that’s clearly not what Nolan was going for. Everything leading up to the explosion was extremely intense, but I loved the sequence following the explosion even better when I experienced it again. The visuals were stunning and it almost seemed Terrence Malick-like when you include the audio of Robert’s slow, deep breath and “now I am become death” quote as well. Keep in mind, Nolan also shows the very beginning of the explosion earlier in the film during some of the montage sequences, which are breathtaking and look exactly like a real atomic bomb a millisecond after explosion (you can find pictures online if you’ve never seen it).

But that wasn’t even the highlight of the film for me. The highlight is the victory speech scene with Robert following the bombing announcement from Truman, and it’s the best scene Nolan has ever directed. Even more brilliant is how he used the sound from the rhythmic pounding of the feet on the bleachers multiple times in the film prior to that in order to set the scene up (as well as in the trailers).

There’s a lot of anti-Nolan sentiment in this subreddit (some justified, some not). He’s made some great films and he’s also made some subpar ones as well (Tenet, TDKR, Inception being his worst in my opinion). But Oppenheimer is his magnum opus. The second viewing is the best theater experience I’ve had in a long time and this film demands a rewatch whether you loved it or were underwhelmed by it after the first."	/r/TrueFilm/comments/15cao1e/after_a_rewatch_oppenheimer_is_unquestionably/	https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/15cao1e/after_a_rewatch_oppenheimer_is_unquestionably/	
oppenheimer	movies	1odan8o	1761145196	ZODIAC KILLER PROJECT - Official Trailer	"&gt;Filmmaker Charlie Shackleton was hot on the trail of the next great American true crime documentary—a riveting account of a highway patrolman’s quixotic effort to identify and capture the infamous Zodiac Killer.

&gt;Shackleton devised a plan, began collecting interviews, and shot “evocative B-roll” footage of ghostly California freeways and parking lots where the killer may have once lurked. And then the project fell apart, leaving Shackleton with fragments of the unfinished film and time to ruminate on shortcuts and signifiers of the ubiquitous genre.

&gt;*Zodiac Killer Project* emerges from the ash heap to probe and deconstruct the form with the incisive eye of a true crime connoisseur. A witty and beautifully assembled deep dive into our obsession with serial killers and the stories we tell about them, Shackleton’s resuscitation of his abandoned film follows in the free-range footsteps of documentary philosophers Errol Morris, Werner Herzog, and Joshua Oppenheimer."	/r/movies/comments/1odan8o/zodiac_killer_project_official_trailer/	https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1odan8o/zodiac_killer_project_official_trailer/	
sound_of_freedom	movies	152qtj4	1689663096	Sound of Freedom / Jim Caviezel (is he a little crazy? Or being slandered?)	"I have been interested in seeing this film and getting more informed about this issue/topic but I'm a bit turned of by the rhetoric around it the movie. 

To me it appears Caviezel has really hurt this film by not showing some political ambiguity and going straight into politics in some of the promotions. Some of which doesn't have much to do with the film. In doing so I think he is also hurting the films ability to raise awareness or picked up by Netflix etc. 

I saw really cringy speech from Caviezel at what may have Qanon event but haven't found a smoking gun yet. Also heard stuff about Caviezel making comparisons to pizza gate level conspiracies theories about rituals around child molestation and so on.

indiana_jones	movies	19ccd8y	1705867633	Question: what makes movies like Indiana Jones and Star Wars better?	I’ve read many articles on how Spielberg and Lucas based Indiana Jones and Star Wars based on B-Movies and serials like Flash Gordon and Buck Rogers and Zorro and I was wondering other than the obvious like budget what else separates those movies from being as well received and universally loved as the materials they are based on?	/r/movies/comments/19ccd8y/question_what_makes_movies_like_indiana_jones_and/	https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/19ccd8y/question_what_makes_movies_like_indiana_jones_and/	
oppenheimer	movies	1h03310	1732594049	2023 Alternate Oscar Nominations: One Nom Per Movie	"So I've made it no secret how much I loved 2023 but I also really did like the Oscar nominations this year. But it still saddens me how many great movies only got a single nom or went 0 for nominations.

I already did an alternate Oscar noms a while back but I thought of different idea. I wanted to spread the love as much as possible and so came my biggest project to date: the 2023 Oscars with each movie only eligible for one nom. Even Best Picture nominees only get that Best Picture nom. I watched as many movies as I could to fill this list up which was a bit tiring but still rewarding with how many discoveries I made.

To give myself some ease, as a rule given how broad the field is, I did only look at the submissions for Best International Feature as to not find up having to go through dozens of other films (luckily this year's noms were all really good). I also did the same for documentaries and what were shortlisted entries but again, a lot of the shortlisted documentaries were all fantastic so no complaints there.

I did also try to be as objective and fair. There are several movies I didn't care for or didn't like overall such as Maestro, Origin, and Showing Up but I could acknowledge one element that really did work that's at least worth recognizing. I didn't want this just to be a list of movies I personally loved ~~(that'll be a different list)~~

And in terms of how I chose which movie went were, it was rather simple.

The Best Picture and Best Directing noms for instance would perhaps be the most well rounded in terms of derserving noms in acting, screenplay, directing, production, score, editing, etc. Poor Things just being relegated to acting would feel wrong given how much of that movie is impressive.

In terms of acting, it had to be for movies who rested on their central performance, even if the writing is thin or abstract thus why A Thousand and One, 20000 Species of Bees, The Iron Claw, Perfect Days, etc. got acting nominations. It's also why I actually moved Teachers' Lounge out of the Best Actress and into Best Screenplay, I just feel that movie is so sharply written, it would feel wrong to just give it an acting nomination. And speaking of screenplay, given how a ton more praise is given to its story, I graduated Godzilla Minus One from VFX to Adapted Screenplay (that and I actually watched Origin and seeing how badly written it was, had to replace it with something)

Song and Score I judged how they fit well outside of the film and how much they would be enjoyed.

Production was straightforward but I did want to shout out Taste of Things because all of the food there was made onsite and that's part of the production and is a character of the film in and of itself.

The others are self-explanatory though I will say I went back and forth between movies in Make-Up and movies in costumes. Both had similar praise.

Unfortunately, I can't add all graphics I made so here

Or on the flipside, a movie *everyone* is gushing over and you, despite really trying, just didn't get the hype or acclaimof.

A personal pick would be The Flash. I had a blast watching it, but reading comments on reddit about it would have you believe it's one of the worst super hero movies of all time. No, screw that. It is *easily* the second best super hero movie of 2023 (admittedly, a very weak year) behind Guardians, and a top three DCEU movie behind The Suicide Squad and Wonder Woman for me.

I get the memes because of the effects and Ezra being a scumbag, but I had a blast and lapped up the nostalgia porn just as it intended.

And on the otherside, Oppenheimer. Yeah, for me the movie was a mess, the effects were just fine, and it was all populated by characters that were more doll like and inhuman than Barbie, a movie about toys."	/r/movies/comments/199ji71/what_is_your_recent_no_its_the_children_who_are/	https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/199ji71/what_is_your_recent_no_its_the_children_who_are/

I thought the score was fun, the flashes of fusion to show his mind working was cool stylistically, but the dialogue for me was awful and it hurt every single acting performance for me. 

None of the dialogue seemed like things people would actually say. It felt like every person was playing a caricature of a person, or like the script was written by AI. The scene where he’s giving the speech and he sees the nuclear fallout out was very interesting but the film felt surprisingly emotional devoid. And the entire part where the staffer slowly turns on RDJ’s character and starts grinning at him being revealed to be this evil 3D chess character just felt… campy? It bordered on comedic for me just because it seemed so corny. I thought I’d walk away feeling something afterwards and I really felt nothing. I understand why the film didn’t show the Japanese, but maybe it could have helped the film feel more human. 

I’m sure I’ll be torn up in the comments, but I just was wondering if anyone else just though it was a 2/3 star movie instead of the Oscar sweep film it ended up being."	/r/flicks/comments/1lv2ofv/disappointed_by_oppenheimer/	https://www.reddit.com/r/flicks/comments/1lv2ofv/disappointed_by_oppenheimer/

Reviews:

[Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/mission-impossible-the-final-reckoning-review-tom-cruise-christopher-mcquarrie-1236215149/) (60):

&gt;If it’s going to be the last we see of one of the most consistently entertaining franchises to come out of Hollywood in the past few decades — a subject about which Cruise and McQuarrie have remained vague — it’s a disappointing farewell with a handful of high points courtesy of the indefatigable lead actor.

[Deadline](https://deadline.com/2025/05/mission-impossible-the-final-reckoning-review-tom-cruise-cannes-1236394481/):

&gt;Is this *really* the end? It’s certainly *an* end, wrapping up seven films’ worth of storylines with a showman’s flourish. What it doesn’t do, though, is rule out another. As Cruise breezes into his mid-60s, it’s hard to imagine him pulling off anything like the high-wire act he achieves here. But the door is still open, and the challenge is there, should anyone else choose to accept it.

[Variety](https://variety.com/2025/film/reviews/mission-impossible-the-final-reckoning-review-tom-cruise-1236396671/) (80):

&gt;It's the most enveloping ""M:I"" film since ""Ghost Protocol,"" because something's at stake. And because Cruise's stunt work is off the hook.

[The Independent ](https://www.the-independent.com/arts-entertainment/films/reviews/mission-impossible-final-reckoning-review-tom-cruise-b2750034.html)(4/5):

&gt;*The Final Reckoning*, final or not, presents us with a fascinating contradiction: Ethan Hunt is both a pure singular and a state of mind. He’s cinema as the madman dreamer’s paradise.

[IndieWire](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/mission-impossible-the-final-reckoning-review-1235122988/) (50):

&gt;“We make our own destiny,” someone intones during the film’s closing voiceover, and by the end of Ethan Hunt’s story, it’s hard not to take those words to heart. I only wish that Cruise and McQuarrie had managed to make a better one.

[The Wrap](https://www.thewrap.com/author/williambibbiani/) (75):

&gt;If this is the end of the 'Mission: Impossible' movies, they ended on an adequate note.

[IGN](https://www.ign.com/articles/mission-impossible-final-reckoning-review-tom-cruise) (6/10):

&gt;While its action is reliably thrilling and a few of its most exciting sequences are sure to hold up through the years, Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning tries to deal with no less than the end of every living thing on the planet – and suffers because of it. The somber tone and melodramatic dialogue miss the mark of what’s made this franchise so much fun for 30 years, but the door is left open for more impossible missions and the hope that this self-serious reckoning isn’t actually final.

[The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/may/14/mission-impossible-the-final-reckoning-review-tom-cruise-wildly-entertaining-adventure) (5/5):

&gt;It is a wildly silly, wildly entertaining adventure which periodically gives us a greatest-hits flashback montage of the other seven films in the M:I canon - but we still get a brand new, box-fresh Tom-sprinting-along-the-street scene, without which it wouldn’t be M:I. Moreover, this eighth film gives us a terrific new character, US sub commander Capt Bledsoe, played with suavity and the tiniest hint of camp by Tramell Tillman (from TV’s Severance) who has the chops for M:I9 whenever that happens.

[Collider](https://collider.com/mission-impossible-the-final-reckoning-review/) (80):

&gt;The Final Reckoning is stuffed, convoluted, and ludicrous at times. But it’s also mostly a great send-off to this universe, a deserved celebration for everything this series has accomplished, and one final (again, seemingly) showcase for Cruise as one of the greatest action stars of all time.

[Slashfilm](https://www.slashfilm.com/1859165/tom-cruise-mission-impossible-the-final-reckoning-review/) (50):

&gt;And yet, The Final Reckoning is too messy, too awkward, too clumsy. It somehow feels overlong and inert even as it never slows down.

[Screendaily](https://www.screendaily.com/reviews/mission-impossible-the-final-reckoning-review-spy-franchise-wraps-a-self-regarding-double-bill/5204859.article) (70):

&gt;The press notes get the tone of the film best: ”It is impossible to overstate how seismically significant the filmmaking partnership between Tom Cruise and Christopher McQuarrie has been on the direction the *Mission: Impossible* franchise has taken since they first joined forces on it,” they intone. “Or how uniquely potent it is.” *Mission Impossible - The Final Reckoning*, the second instalment in a globally-shot, monumental multi-year concurrent film-making effort which should be lauded for its ambition, knows what popcorn cinema escapism is all about. But, like the perennially defiant Hunt, it sometimes over-estimates its own powers.

Directed by Christopher McQuarrie:

&gt;Ethan Hunt and the IMF team continue their search for the terrifying AI known as the Entity — which has infiltrated intelligence networks all over the globe — with the world’s governments and a mysterious ghost from Ethan’s past on their trail. Joined by new allies and armed with the means to shut the Entity down for good, Hunt is in a race against time to prevent the world as we know it from changing forever.

They only gave him give-or-take 10 minutes to work with but I really feel like he knocked it out of the park on his acting.

[Here's a video which shows most of the scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKYWXIAJKNM). There's a couple minutes after but that's mostly dialogue / exposition to set up the very next scene.

It's already a really silly sequence, but the way he does it makes it so much more entertaining imo. He's so *expressive.* Every little body movement, the way his face changes, the way he moves from place to place. For example at 2:14 he doesn't just run down that hill, he's running so fast he's almost falling. Or at 3:45, the way he runs across that train car.

I love how much it reminds me of silent films, the way actors had to rely on body language due to the lack of dialogue without interstitles. The whole sequence is mostly devoid of dialogue apart from a few parts here and there, so I imagine this was intentional, but I just love how much he nailed it."	/r/TrueFilm/comments/1hqolgf/i_love_how_expressive_river_phoenix_is_in_the/	https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/1hqolgf/i_love_how_expressive_river_phoenix_is_in_the/	
oppenheimer	movies	1bhq8qu	1710767103	Oppenheimer is seriously flawed and is no where near Nolans best film!	"While there are undeniable amazing moments and impactful scenes overall it was way too ""baggy"" and slow. The cutting back and forth takes you away from the main story and the whole Robert Downey Jr Scientist backstabbing sub plot could easily have dropped and at least  half an hour trimmed. After someone has created a bomb which kills thousands of people who really cares if he loses his security clearance? 

I remember in the cinema being dissapointed everytime we left the main story and went back to the boring court room scenes. I hoped that these  would be more interesting and pay off on a rewatch but they really didn\`t they just made it seem slower. 

Nolan obviously deserves many oscars but it\`s a shame it came for one which is one of his weakest efforts."	/r/movies/comments/1bhq8qu/oppenheimer_is_seriously_flawed_and_is_no_where/	https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1bhq8qu/oppenheimer_is_seriously_flawed_and_is_no_where/

oppenheimer	movies	1czrdhi	1716574506	Confusion over Oppenheimer Interrogation Ending	"Specifically when Robb and Opp were fully yelling at each other, and Opp stated “us creating a hydrogen bomb would make them create it just as it did with the atomic”. Robb then uses that as a big point of his argument to demonstrate his argument about Opp’s communist ties, saying “no moral scruples in 45, plenty in 49”. 


Why did Christopher Nolan put so much emphasis on this exact moment? I’ve seen people say that it exposes Oppenheimer, but I don’t think it really does. This easily tied into previous evidence in the movie that Oppenheimer opposed proliferation after the war since he was trying to avoid an arms race. And the next line seemed more significant, since it showed Oppenheimer’s justification for pivoting feelings towards the bombs."	/r/movies/comments/1czrdhi/confusion_over_oppenheimer_interrogation_ending/	https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1czrdhi/confusion_over_oppenheimer_interrogation_ending/

barbie	TrueFilm	15dmmld	1690726408	Dancer in the Dark (2000) film review - an analysis of von Trier's tour de force	"I want to preface this post by saying that yes, I have seen Oppenheimer, and yes, I have seen Barbie, and no, I will not be discussing either (at least not right now haha). Instead, I will be discussing what is probably my second favourite film by my favourite director. If you have not yet had the pleasure of watching 'Dancer in the Dark' please do. I will keep this excerpt of my review/analysis **spoiler free** for that purpose.

In his award-winning musical drama ‘Dancer in the Dark’, Lars von Trier depicts Czech immigrant factory worker Selma, whose sight is rapidly deteriorating. As Selma undergoes struggles in her life, she escapes increasingly often into musical daydreams. ‘Dancer in the Dark’ is the final film in von Trier’s ‘Golden Heart Trilogy’, and explores the heartbreaking collision of an innocent idealistic girl with a cruel, self-serving society. As with his 1996 film ‘Breaking the Waves’, ‘Dancer in the Dark’ displays von Trier’s attempts to project himself onto female characters and thus examine the repressed ‘feminine’ attributes of his personality, such as religious belief, emotion, and self sacrifice. When questioned about the suffering of the female characters in his films, von Trier has simply stated ‘those characters are not women. They are self-portraits.’ There is no doubt that ‘Dancer in the Dark’ is a divisive film, but I found it to be an utterly enthralling and devastating play on a genre I usually despise.

It must be stated here that I am a longtime admirer of Lars von Trier as a director. I have, for the most part, held back from writing about his films for fear of not doing them the justice they deserve, or perhaps for fear of writing a biassed and dogmatic piece. I was moved to action after my fourth viewing of ‘Dancer in the Dark’ at a local film festival, where I once again finished the film in tears. Björk’s astoundingly honest portrayal of Selma, coupled with von Trier’s twisted take on the classic Hollywood musical, creates a viewing experience that is at once magical and nightmarish.

Musical segments in ‘Dancer in the Dark’ are coupled with a vibrant attack of colour and a shift from the subjective handheld camera; thus, as the film progresses, the viewer is made increasingly aware of the contrast between the depressing reality of Selma’s life and the idealism of her musical daydreams. Though the musical segments of ‘Dancer in the Dark’ provide the viewer with brief respite from the film’s gruelling portrayal of Selma’s suffering, each return to the film’s narrative becomes more and more difficult to bear. In fact, it is hard to imagine ‘Dancer in the Dark’ delivering the perfection it does without the presence of Björk. The innocence she exudes as Selma and her characteristically strange yet hauntingly beautiful musical performances provide a much-needed counterbalance to von Trier’s unyielding directorial style. As Selma, Björk embodies exquisitely the martyr-like, humanistic qualities of the heroines of the Golden Heart Trilogy.

‘Dancer in the Dark’ is tragically beautiful, and possesses the rare ability to quite literally take your breath away whilst you are watching it. You do not have to support von Trier, the controversial figure that he is, to appreciate the masterfully experimental and dazzlingly provocative nature of his filmmaking. Björk is always astounding, and the emotional intensity of her performance as Selma is at once spellbinding and agonising. Von Trier’s Golden Heart trilogy is, in my opinion, the best showcase of his work.

oppenheimer	movies	1n71xvm	1756863495	I feel like The Prestige (2006) is Christopher Nolan’s most slept on movie	"I remember The Dark Knight trilogy been my introduction to Christopher Nolan’s work, and from that I started watching all his movies. I still think The Prestige is one of his most slept on films. Inception, Interstellar, Oppenheimer, the Batman movies, etc, etc, I know they’re all big hitters, but I really think The Prestige is his greatest movie.

Non-linear storytelling is used often by Nolan, but in The Prestige it’s really done excellently through the use of both protagonists journals. The acting is top notch, the cinematography is great, etc, but it’s the story itself that really elevates everything to stratospheric heights.

David Bowie as Tesla is one of the greatest casting decisions of all time. That whole subplot plays out wonderfully, connecting to the main narrative through Tesla’s machine. I don’t know how to explain it, but the machine itself leaves the audience with a really foreboding, uneasy feeling, like this thing shouldn’t exist. Perhaps because the movie is grounded in most aspects, but the machine and the final reveal gave me goosebumps watching it this time around. The score helps in this regard, with the music more heavy whenever we see it.

If you’ve never seen this movie, I encourage you to watch it. It really is something special."	/r/movies/comments/1n71xvm/i_feel_like_the_prestige_2006_is_christopher/	https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1n71xvm/i_feel_like_the_prestige_2006_is_christopher/	
oppenheimer	movies	1mqv1gz	1755257223	Oppenheimer is MID	Despite being 3 hours, the pacing is so fast you barely have time to realise what is happening, ontop of that, the dialogue rarely explains what is happening even thought its the primary tool in every scene, literally every scene. Due to this it you need to know the story,history, and science terminology that took place in the movie before watching it.

movies that immediately come to mind when thinking about pretentious low brow films are: Crash (2004) and Cloud Atlas (2012) and Joker (2019).

mi7	TrueFilm	15acs8u	1690394153	Was anyone else underwhelmed by Mission Impossible Dead Reckoning?	"Perhaps I went in excepting too much but I felt it was quite a letdown. MI movies are never known for their stories but I felt the storytelling was seriously lacking. Every scene was either an action scene or terrible exposition. Yea the other films have had exposition but they at least tried to make it snappy. This was just so much boring and poorly written dialogue. 

The whole AI knows every move you’re going to make isn’t a novel one and doesn’t feel properly utilized at all. I don’t get the point of the intro on the sub. I thought the characters knew throughout the movie that the macguffin was on a submarine but in the end I realized they didn’t and it had me questioning the point of that sequence. Also the whole Ethan and Gabriel past felt very shoehorned in. 

The movie was way longer than it needed to be. I don’t mind king movies when it’s deserving but this just seemed like they left nothing on the cutting room floor. 

And this might be the most controversial but the action felt pretty mediocre. These movies are usually praised for their lack of cgi and use of real stunts but I felt like this had. A lot of cgi in action sequences were that were the same as we’ve seen a hundred times. The only truly jaw dropping moment was the cliff jump, but all the other stunts felt… fine. Some of the train stuff was cool although the fight on top wasn’t very good. The car chase was super forgettable. Nothing besides the cliff jump really stood out as incredible moments. Meanwhile Fallout had the skydiving sequence, a great bathroom fight scene, crazy helicopter sequences, and more. 

I also feel like the movie had a weird thing against women but that’s a discussion for another day."	/r/TrueFilm/comments/15acs8u/was_anyone_else_underwhelmed_by_mission/	https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/15acs8u/was_anyone_else_underwhelmed_by_mission/	
mi7	movies	1l7kskh	1749514232	June 6-8 Box Office Recap – 'Ballerina' disappoints with just $24.5M, allowing 'Lilo &amp; Stitch' to stay at #1 for the third week 'The Phoenician Scheme' debuts in wide release with an okay $6.2M. 'Lilo &amp; Stitch' crosses $700M worldwide, while 'Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning' crosses $450M.	"https://preview.redd.it/zgb2eu7vrz5f1.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=862e8e8c963f9b6d98ed9e0b6ea1da6611037d54

Without much competition this weekend, ***Lilo &amp; Stitch*** managed to snatch #1 for the third weekend in a row. Lionsgate tried to counter with their ***John Wick*** spin-off, ***Ballerina***, but it fell short of expectations. Wes Anderson's ***The Phoenician Scheme*** also made its debut in wide release, although it wasn't a very memorable opening.

The Top 10 earned a combined $104.9 million this weekend. That's up 5.2% from last year, when ***Bad Boys: Ride or Die*** topped the box office.

***Lilo &amp; Stitch*** stayed at #1 for the third weekend in a row, earning $32.3 million this weekend. That represents a rough 47.6% drop, which is worse than ***The Little Mermaid*** (44.1%) and ***Aladdin*** (42.4%). That's weird, considering the film didn't share much of an audience with ***Ballerina*** this weekend. In fact, the film is now running $8 million behind ***A Minecraft Movie*** through the same point, despite having a big advantage on its fourth day onwards. 

These drops aren't great at all. Family films usually hold well, but ***Lilo &amp; Stitch*** is dropping faster than usual. But with $335.6 million in the bank already, it's not really much to worry about. Regardless, with ***How to Train Your Dragon*** premiering this week, it will continue having rough drops. The film is not hitting $450 million domestically, and it should finish with around $420 million. That means the film won't hit a 3x multiplier, which is what family films easily achieve.

Making its way to 3,409 theaters, ***Ballerina*** opened with a very disappointing $24.5 million this weekend. These numbers are below the past three ***John Wick*** titles***, which range from $30 million to $73 million. It's not even Ana de Armas' biggest debut as lead or co-lead (***Knives Out*** is higher at $26.7 million).

Spin-offs are a complicated case at the box office. For every one that explodes (***Minions***, ***Rogue One***), there's always far more that just fail to manifest (***Solo: A Star Wars Story***, ***Elektra***, ***The Huntsman: Winter's War***, ***Evan Almighty***, etc.). Even more complicated are spin-offs of characters we never knew before, which is the case with ***Ballerina***. Sure, Lionsgate did a job in trying to connect it as much as possible to the ***John Wick*** franchise (to the point that they had that annoying ***From the World of John Wick*** in the title), but that doesn't mean the audience will watch anything related if the lead character isn't here.

Now, John Wick is definitely in the film (Lionsgate made sure to include him in the posters and trailers), but his presence is very minimal, opting to focus on the new character, Eve. But one thing that may have contributed to its lost revenue is the interest cooling off: this film was supposed to come out last June, but was delayed a full year as the film underwent reshoots. [These reportedly lasted 2-3 months and were helmed by Chad Stahelski without Len Wiseman on set.](https://www.thewrap.com/lionsgate-box-office-slump-ballerina-reshoots/) Although there's a [new report](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-features/ballerina-director-john-wick-3-connections-1236257808/) where both Stahelski and Wiseman refute that claim, claiming they collaborated and the reshoots weren't that big. Now, the audience generally isn't aware of production issues; they only care if the film looks good or interesting. With that said, Lionsgate built negative buzz after it was [reported](https://deadline.com/2025/05/lionsgate-ballerina-embargoes-positive-negative-critics-1236409583/) that they only wanted positive social media reactions of the film posted before its review embargo, causing many to worry over its quality prospects. It was all for nothing, given it has a solid 75% on RT, although that's below the rest of the franchise.

According to Lionsgate, 63% of the audience was male, and 76% of the audience was 25 and over. At the very least, not everything is disappointing: audiences gave the film an ""A–"" on CinemaScore, the same grade as the second and third ***John Wick*** film. Maybe it could hold on well, but with heavy summer competition, it's very unlikely ***Ballerina*** can get to $75 million domestically.

In third place, ***Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning*** dropped 45.5% this weekend, adding $14.8 million. Not a bad drop, but not great either. The film has earned $149 million domestically, and it's probably going to finish with around $185 million domestically.

***Karate Kid: Legends*** earned $8.5 million on its second weekend. That's a very poor 57.8% drop from last weekend. In contrast, the 2010 version eased just 46.3% on its second weekend (a second weekend that's actually higher than ***Legends***' opening weekend). Through 10 days, the film has earned just $35.3 million, which is simply a very poor figure for the franchise. With heavy competition on its way, it will probably continue falling like a rock. Right now, the film will finish with around $50 million, pretty much less than the 2010 version's opening weekend ($55 million).

In fifth place, ***Final Destination: Bloodlines*** is stabilizing. It dropped just 40.8%, adding $6.4 million this weekend. The film has already made $123.5 million in the bank, officially passing any of the prior films adjusted for inflation. It should finish with around $140 million domestically.

Wes Anderson's ***The Phoenician Scheme*** expanded to 1,678 theaters, earning $6.2 million. Counting its numbers from its limited performance last week, the film has crossed $7 million domestically. That's below ***Asteroid City***'s wide debut ($9 million), but it wasn't really expected to top that film. 

This is an okay start for the film. At this point, Anderson's name is pretty much the selling point; either you are already in or you just don't care, it's just that simple. The film offered pretty much the same things everyone loves about his films. Reviews aren't as glowing as Anderson's previous films (78% on RT), but no one interested was going to be dissuaded from watching this.

According to Focus Features, 56% of the audience was male and skewed young (59% was 18-34). They gave it a very weak ""B–"" on CinemaScore, which is even lower than ***Asteroid City***. It's unlikely it can hold as well as that film, so it's pretty much set to finish with less than $20 million domestically. Don't fear for Anderson's future, though; he's already working on his next film.

A24's ***Bring Her Back*** dropped 51% and added $3.5 million this weekend. Not a bad drop for a horror film, although it's clear it won't hold as well as ***Talk to Me***. Through 10 days, it has earned $14.1 million, and it's unlikely it can pass $20 million.

***Dan Da Dan: Evil Eye*** debuted in just 1,085 theaters, but that was enough to hit $3.1 million this weekend. That's pretty good, although like other anime films, it's gonna be front-loaded as hell.

***Sinners*** dropped 46.4% and added $2.8 million this weekend. 8 weekends in, and the film has yet to fall at least 50%. Truly impressive run. The film has amassed $272.5 million domestically, and it will soon pass ***Gravity*** as the biggest live-action original film of the past 14 years.

Rounding up the Top 10 was ***Thunderbolts***, which is nearing the end of its run. It dropped 49.5%, earning $2.4 million this weekend. The film's domestic total stands at $186.4 million, and it's officially finishing below $195 million domestically.

***Dangerous Animals*** debuted with a weak $1.5 million in 1,636 theaters. Expect it to fade quickly.

Kevin Smith's ***Dogma*** returned to theaters for its 25th anniversary. It managed to hit $1 million ($2.1 million four-day) despite playing in 700 theaters. That took its lifetime gross to $32.7 million.

Neon released Mike Flanagan's ***The Life of Chuck*** in 16 theaters, although it earned a soft $224,585. That's an underwhelming $14,036 per-theater average (usually these films gross around $30K or more). What does this suggest? That interest may not be as high as expected. It's set for a wide release this weekend, although it's likely that the film does not hit it out of the park.

#**OVERSEAS**

***Lilo &amp; Stitch*** was once again #1 this weekend, earning $67.7 million overseas for a $772.2 million worldwide total. It debuted in its final market, Japan, earning $4 million this weekend. The best markets are Mexico ($56.8M), UK ($42.2M), France ($30.4M), Brazil ($28.2M) and Germany ($23.7M). As previously said, it will reach $1 billion but its faster-than-usual drops indicate that it won't make it much further than that. Quite disappointing, considering its opening weekend suggested it could've gone for $1.2 billion or more.

***Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning*** added $40.6 million overseas this weekend, lifting its worldwide numbers to $450 million. Its biggest markets are China ($47.5M), the UK ($27.8M), Japan ($23.4M), Korea ($20.5M) and France ($17.7M). It will definitely outgross ***Dead Reckoning*** ($567 million), but it's a question mark if it can hit $600 million worldwide.

***Ballerina*** debuted with $26 million overseas, for a $50 million worldwide debut. That's below the forecast, which was already far below the previous ***John Wick*** films. For reference, ***John Wick: Chapter*** debuted with $138 million worldwide. It had very soft debuts in China ($3M), UK ($2.5M) and Mexico ($1.9M). With competition on its way, ***Ballerina*** will probably miss $150 million, failing to recoup its $90 million budget. Ouch.

***Karate Kid: Legends*** added $10 million this weekend, for a $73.9 million worldwide total. It has performed very softly so far in all its markets, and there's not a lot of countries left. It should close with around $110 million worldwide, which would be quite disappointing.

With $8.7 million overseas this weekend, ***Final Destination: Bloodlines*** has crossed $257 million worldwide. This is definitely finishing with almost $290 million. Where's that sequel announcement, WB?

- Hi-Ho. Hi-Ho. Hi-Holy shit. Disney's ***Snow White*** has closed with a horrible $205 million worldwide, far less than its $270 million budget. Absolutely pathetic. An anemic 2.07 multiplier, which is simply poor for family films. But here's the thing everyone will say: is anyone truly surprised? Everything that could have gone wrong, went horribly wrong. And now it's one of the biggest flops in history.

- The Weekend probably is saying ""I hope you cry for me."" Mmm, nah, I don't think so, Abel. ***Hurry Up Tomorrow*** has closed after just 3 weeks with a poor $6 million worldwide. It's crazy to see how low it could go after the film snatched some of the year's worst reviews. Maybe this is it for The Weekend as a leading star. Pretty funny memes tho. 

#**THIS WEEKEND**

The ***Lilo &amp; Stitch*** live-action remake will cede the top spot to... another live-action remake.

Yep. DreamWorks' ***How to Train Your Dragon*** is finally arriving, just 15 years after the original was released. Quite a short time to make a remake, isn't it? Well, for $ome rea$on, Univer$al decided to $imply get Dean DeBloi$ to make a remake. Why would he do it? Gee, I don't know what it i$. In fact, there's a lot of shot-for-shot scenes in this film. If this is a hit (and we all know it will be), expect more DreamWorks Animation remakes. *sigh*

A24 is also releasing Celine Song's new film, ***Materialists***, starring Dakota Johnson, Chris Evans and Pedro Pascal. She hit gold with ***Past Lives***, and this film is aiming to be even broader, hoping to attract more people. With a pretty great marketing campaign in the past few days and a very well known cast, this could be a sleeper hit for A24.

And as mentioned earlier, Neon is expanding ***The Life of Chuck*** into wide release. After its weak numbers in limited release, the film will really need to step up its game to not disappoint.

oppenheimer	movies	1bevybw	1710450124	The film industry has fallen off - a comparison of Best Picture winners from 2001-2010 and 2015-2024.	"This is the list of Best Pictures (Oscars) from 2010 to 2001:

* ""The Hurt Locker"" (2009)
* ""Slumdog Millionaire"" (2008)
* ""No Country for Old Men"" (2007)
* ""The Departed"" (2006)
* ""Crash"" (2005)
* ""Million Dollar Baby"" (2004)
* ""The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King"" (2003)
* ""Chicago"" (2002)
* ""A Beautiful Mind"" (2001)
* ""Gladiator"" (2000)

Now compare that with the list from 2024 to 2015:

* ""Oppenheimer"" (2023)
* ""Everything Everywhere All At Once"" (2022)
* ""CODA"" (2021)
* ""Nomadland"" (2020)
* ""Parasite"" (2019)
* ""Green Book"" (2018)
* ""The Shape of Water"" (2017)
* ""Moonlight""(2016)
* ""Spotlight"" (2015)
* ""Birdman"" (2014)

The discrepancy is insane.

Take the Departed for example. Does any move from the 2015-2024 list even compare to the Departed? Or Gladiator? Or Hurt Locker? I know that for a lot of us these movies benefit from nostalgia but even from an objective standpoint these two lists are like night and day to me. Oppenheimer was GOOD but was it Best Picture worthy? No way. It just happened to not have any competition.

TLDR; Movies were better in the 2000s and early 2010s compared to now. Whether this is due to randomness or an actual decline in movie quality is up for debate.

EDIT: What is actually interesting is a lot of people are saying my taste seems to be more ""graphic/violent"". This may be true. What is also true is the Oscars has worked very hard to diversify its judges and pool of movies. There is a possibility that movies (ie Departed, Hurt Locker, No Country for Old Men etc) that only spoke to older white males (for reference I am not white but am male) might have won in the past and now many more types of movies are winning."	/r/movies/comments/1bevybw/the_film_industry_has_fallen_off_a_comparison_of/	https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1bevybw/the_film_industry_has_fallen_off_a_comparison_of/

Day 49: South Carolina winner was Full Metal Jacket. What a wild flick. Probably my favorite from Kubric.(not a cinephile) I’ve seen that movie so many times and it’s always new. 

Today is day 50 (out of 51, be back tomorrow)  and it’s California, my half way was New York and I decided these last two would be the Enders. California has cities, beaches, desert, forests, military bases, and borders, all of which lend themselves to the movies there. I don’t think there’s a single movie that can crouch how rich californias culture is but it’s Hollywood. Let’s see!

I’ve also made a controversial decision to overrule the Georgia/Forrest Gump decision. It’s going to Gone with the Wind. Consider it my one veto. This will be polarizing.

oppenheimer	TrueFilm	1ompg7i	1762109487	Peter Watkins, the most prescient director you've never heard of, has died. His legacy, however, will outlive us all	"Peter Watkins died on October 30th, 2025. That his death came and went with little fanfare is a sad injustice, as Watkins is one of the most radical, ahead of his time filmmakers in history. But his talent is inversely proportional to his recognition: due to the stunning and difficult movies he made (in style and subject matter) and the virulent attacks from official parties and critics that he received, his work is often elusive and hard to find. But when found, it's a revelation. 

Watkins' bread and butter style of filmmaking is difficult to name, but the one I go with is pseudo-documentary, or docudrama. To put it simply, he makes documentaries on fake scenarios and presents them as though they're real, somewhat similar to found footage movies, or mockumentaries (although mockumentary implies that it belongs to the comedy genre, and Watkins's films are anything but comedic). His pseudo documentaries come complete with a running voiceover, talking head interviews, and people acknowledging the existence of the camera and it's operator. It's a compelling conceit, but it's the scenarios that Watkins crafts through them that makes his work so compelling. 

His most famous (but still critically underseen) movie is Punishment Park, released in 1971. It takes place in an ""alternate"" history USA where the McCaren act, which allows the president to jail those he believes will engage in insurrection, is in full effect. Those who are jailed are given a choice: serve out their sentence to it's completion, or participate in Punishment Park. The goal of the park is to cross a desert in under 3 days and reach an american flag, all the while running from police who will hunt you down. Fail to reach it in time, and you'll be forced back to prison, if you're not killed outright. Do it successfully, and you'll be set free... 

I've never seen a movie that's been able to boil my blood in one second then chill it to the bone in the very next. Even though it's fictional, it's difficult not to see the real world parallels of it's time and now. I first saw this in 2021, and the George Floyd murder and riots remained fresh in my mind. The police brutality on display in concert with the documentary format made the events hit really close to home, as did the increasing polarization and feeling of helplessness that permeated the entire film. On a technical level, it's also massively impressive how Watkins is able to craft an entire environment and world through little more than clever sound design and claustrophobic camera work. It's a vital piece of film that should be studied the world over, but when it came out, the film was violently attacked. Attacks from more conservative voices were expected, but critics also lambasted the film for presenting itself as a documentary, as though the documentary format was a sacred ground of truth reserved only for real world stories, and anything approximating it is blasphemy. These critics failed to realize that that was precisely the point: to make the viewers question what they saw and to encourage them to see all future documentaries in a critical light. 

That leads us to the other half of Watkins' style and goal of film: forcing the audience to reflect on what it is they see. His choice of political pseudo-documentaries was not arbitrary: he saw how video was/is becoming the principal form of both entertainment and information, and rather than add on the pile with the same thing that everyone else was making, he wanted to make movies that made the audience actually digest the media they consume. He took to calling the vast majority of movies ""the monoform."" He identified the monoform as, quote, ""a rapid flow of changing images or scenes, constant camera movement, and dense layers of sound,"" end quote. He believed that these movies neutralized self-reflection and dulled the average viewer's senses so that their attention span would be unable to fully digest what it is they saw. What Watkins also took issue with is how it seemed that EVERY form of Mass Audio Visual Media took its cues from the monoform, so that whether you watched a movie, a documentary, a tv show, or a news program, the same techniques were being used. Watkins believed the end result of all of this was a destroying of a modern audience's media literacy and a stifling of projects that didn't conform to the monoform that could otherwise exist. 

Look at the modern day media landscape: TikTok reels and shorts from other websites give us cookie cutter videos that we consume and create with equal pleasure, promising us quick info or laughs and a chance to go viral. Debates range endlessly here and on Twitter over media literacy, and whether someone correctly consumed a piece of media or not. And, with only a few exceptions, the majority of Hollywood movies are made from the same template that consists of franchise potential, CGI spectacle and market research surveys. Watkins was right. He was right about all of it.

Now, we can argue about both his own methods and whether things are truly as bad as he believed they were. I DO think a movie can include fast cuts, roving camera movement, and layered sound design and still force the audience to reflect on what they saw. But the fact is that whether they follow the monoform or not, few movies have the goal of actually engaging the audience beyond surface level thrills. And the MAJOR problem isn't that the monoform exists, but that it comprises the overwhelming majority of mainstream movies. 

To put it simply, Watkins, in his craft, his subject matter, his theories, and his vision of the future, was staggeringly ahead of his time. His final film, La Commune, was released in the year 2000, after which he retired from filmmaking. And, ironically enough, it was in the 21st century where his ideas of mass media as a propaganda tool and independent documentaries vying for an unvarnished truth came to full fruition. In this respect he deserves to be put on the same pantheon as Orson Welles and Jean Luc Goddard. But unlike Welles and Goddard, he never did have that much recognition outside of his native Britain.

His radical output put him at odds not just with official institutions that provided his funding (hence his nomadic career), but with critics and professors, themselves the true gatekeepers of what movies they expose to the next generations and what movies they keep under lock and key. And the end result is Watkin's relative obscurity in comparison with other directors. On letterboxd, a site dedicated exclusively to film fans, his most popular movie is Punishment Park, which only has 32 thousand watches and 23 thousand ratings (it's worse on IDMB, where it only has 8 thousand ratings). Edvard Munch was once in the top 250 highest rated films, but every time the ratings threshold is updated, it's always on the chopping black due to it's lack of popularity. His availability on physical media has also been a factor, at least in the US. On DVD his movies aren't difficult to find, but on Blu-ray it's a goddamn minefield. Punishment Park USED to be readily available through Eureka, but it got discontinued recently, and now copies are quite elusive. The same is true of Edvard Munch, and many of his best movies seemingly never even got an official Blu-ray release, like La Commune. Of all things, Privilege got an official Region A Blu-ray, while Culloden and The War Game got a double feature, but only in Region B. 

I'm not saying that outside forces are exclusively to blame. Watkins work, by design was never made to be simple entertainment. It wasn't even meant to be exploitative and shocking. It was meant to rouse your emotions on a truly visceral level and engage your intellect long after you finished watching the movie. Because of this, even his shorter movies are deeply harrowing, and as his movies got longer and the subject matter more intense (his film Resan, a 14 hour movie about the nuclear age, is one of the longest in history), it becomes more difficult to sit down and get through his work. But when you do, it'll inevitably be some of the most eye-opening and enriching filmmaking that you'll ever get through.

Where to start with Peter Watkins? I think it's difficult to go wrong with either Punishment Park or The War Game, the latter about a hypothetical nuclear attack on England.. They're fairly short, for one thing, but they're pretty good distillments of what Watkins is about, and are, of course, genuinely great movies. People talk a lot about pairing Oppenheimer with other movies, but if you want to have some fun, watch Oppenheimer, then Fail-Safe, then The War Game. I think that'll be a pretty good trilogy. Culloden is also excellent. It does at times have a slight feeling of cheapness that can get in the way (a problem that's fully rectified with Punishment Park), but it's a minor complaint: the end result is a stunning debut film that proves you don't need a lot of money to make an impactful period piece: just a strong point of view and clever usage of your resources. Edvard Munch, his most personal movie, and La Commune, his final triumph, both jockey for the title of his magnum opus, but are extremely long and difficult to find, so I recommend working your way up to them. The same is true of Resan, or the Journey, which you almost have no choice but to watch it in segments, which Watkins actually recommends. Privilege is a bit of a strange outlier in his filmography, but it's ideas of pop stars as government puppets trying to regain their individuality remains potent. The Gladiators (or the Peace Game) is even more prescient, anticipating both Battle Royale and the Hunger Games with it's depictions of televised battles to the death, all done as a means to control the populace. The rest of his feature filmography break the rarity scale: these movies don't even have so much as Wikipedia articles, let alone official physical releases in english. Good news if you live in france, however. Of all places, Doriane Films has almost all of his work available on DVD. 

As you can see, Watkins is a difficult filmmaker to find his movies, he's a difficult filmmaker to get into, and he's a difficult filmmaker to fully comprehend. But nothing that was ever worth anything ever came easy. Peter Watkins is one of the greatest and most important filmmakers of the 20th century, and despite his passing, despite his obscurity, the arc of history has proven him right. Here's hoping that the arc of history gives him the proper recognition in death that he never got in life."	/r/TrueFilm/comments/1ompg7i/peter_watkins_the_most_prescient_director_youve/	https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/1ompg7i/peter_watkins_the_most_prescient_director_youve/	
barbie	movies	1asoapf	1708129473	IMO, the animated movie Iron Giant could have been big if not for the poor marketing. What are some other movies that could have had way more success if not for poor marketing (or lack of it)?	"Lots of good movies fail and bad movies succeed for reasons other than how good the movie is. One big factor is marketing.

There have been other movies where either bad marketing or a lack of it likely resulted in them bombing. An example is one of my favorite animated movies, The Iron Giant. Many people blame the bad marketing for the movie's failure, at least initially. I think the movie could have had way more success because it's so well made.

Compare that with, say, Barbie. Warner Bros. spent $150 million on marketing for Barbie, which is more than the budget to produce the film itself, as expensive as it was! Such a risky thing, but now the movie has made nearly 1.5 billion dollars so the marketing guys look like geniuses. Would the movie have been as successful without the expensive marketing? I doubt it.

oppenheimer	movies	1jmgo1z	1743231608	Revisiting Oppenheimer: the film you convinced yourself was amazing.	"So when I first watched Oppenheimer, it went a little something like this: 

God I love Cillian, I’m so excited for this.. wowww the shots are beautiful.. he’s such a great actor.. hmm this scene is a little slow.. oooh they’re talking about physics, its about to pick up.. *looks at watch*.. why are there 7 A-list stars in this scene, so distracting.. why do they keep talking about the least interesting aspect of this story.. *looks at watch for the 3rd time*.. oh shit, they’re testing it finally, oooh.. oh jesus they’re talking about politics again.. *looks at watch for 5th time*.. wait this is the entire focus of the story isn’t it.. *looks at watch for the 8th time*.. wtf was that..

Skip to scouring the internet for someone to validate my frustration and confusion for hours. Which I did find in the dusty corners of reddit but I couldn’t shake this feeling that this was some kind of crowd hypnosis happening. How did a film from an amazing director, starring one of my favorite actors, about a topic I’m super interested in.. bore me to fucking tears? And why is this film solely about the absolute most boring and now completely irrelevant part of this fascinating story? Who cares whether Oppenheimer had a connection with communists? Like there is so much meat on this drumstick, why are we chewing on the bone? 

So what should it have been about? Well I’m glad you asked, how about.. the science, the war, the philosophical dilemma, how atomic fission works, what the possible futures could look like, the genocidal act, the reason the bomb was used, the aftermath in Japan, the beginning of the actual Cold War… And I can hear you thinking “But good sir, some of that shit *WAS* in the movie.” How about this, take whats in the trailer and delete it from the film. How much of any of that stuff is left in the film? 10 minutes? There was more small talk in the film than science, war, and philosophy combined. I mean I guess Nolan really wanted us to know what the boring, ordinary parts of Oppenheimer’s life were like so we could really get to know him before he gets grilled about being a communist in the conclusion?

Speaking of the trailer.. if people wanted to hear endless meandering conversations about politics and communism and small talk, why is the trailer cherry picking the only parts of the film that are actually entertaining? I mean if the trailer were an accurate representation of the film, the trailer would suck, let’s be real. The trailer focuses on what the film should have focused on, and instead the film appears to have only included enough interesting scenes so a misleading trailer could be made for the film.

Anyway, enough ranting. Time for you to answer the important questions: Have you rewatched it? Will you ever, honeslty? If the exact same film was made by an unknown director with an unknown cast of the same talent, would you have loved it? If everyone in your life and in the media said it flopped, would you still think its “one of the greatest films of all time” (as countless people wouldn’t stop saying last summer)? Do you really give a shit about the communist/red scare part of the story? And last but not least..

oppenheimer	TrueFilm	15burik	1690543584	Oppenheimer was nice but Memento was 23 years ago and it's high time Nolan gets over it	"This movie taught me Oppenheimer's life was turbulent and I'm surprised he didn't get a biopic earlier. Unfortunately the biopic we got spent way too long on plot and not enough on people.

I'd rather have seen a movie that tells the story in default chronological order this time. Nolan once again wants to build a puzzle when he could have just feasted on the complex relationships and contradictions in Oppenheimer's life.

Just that. No villains, no twists, no jump cuts.

We get bits and pieces of characters scattered around the movie, we barely have time to relate and examine any character other than Oppenheimer.

But Nolan's obsession with puzzle-movies also gets in the way of the central character study. The main issue: He builds the movie so we *piece together* how Oppenheimer dealt with guilt instead of building a movie where we *feel* why he did so.

Massive moments of Oppenheimer's life are handed to us cold because the movie is so scattered, like Oppenheimer learning of Jean Tatlock's death.

I'd take 1 minute of the camera just resting on Murphy face in silence over 1 minute of trailer-like jump cuts.

I'd have preferred seeing more of Oppenheimer's relationships rather than building half the movie around a plot twist (Robert Downey Jr. was actually the bad guy).

The movie works in a few contrived triumph/downfall scenes for a few actors (Emily Blunt, Rami Malek, Robert Downey Jr.) on what felt like a paint-by-numbers need to have those moments in. This is what I mean about too much on plot and not enough on people.

Robert Oppenheimer led the development of the A-bomb, I think the fallout from that overshadows the entire commie hearings the movie spent half its time on. An entire half of the movie that can be summed up to ""Lewis Strauss had hurt feelings"", too much just so we had a villain and a twist.

The pivotal moment of the Lewis' grudge and the Oppenheimer/Lewis relationship gets significantly less screen time than the reveal that Lewis had a spite plot.

The acting and massively loud sound carried this movie, I might've actually disliked it had I watched it at home.

In Memento the gimmick of constant time jumps and puzzles was integral to the movie, but Nolan keeps working that in about half his movies (Dunkirk didn't need it either). I wish someone else had made an Oppenheimer biopic.

Hey  guys! I love doing projects like this just for fun. I love rating and  ranking movies and doing brackets. It's a real sweet spot for me. I had  this idea the other day so I figured I should pursue it. How this came  to be was that I took a look at the most popular movies on Letterboxd,  then I split them up into the 8 genres you see above. The seeds were  simply determined by how high they were on Letterboxd's popularity list.  There was a little bit of fudging with the genres just to make  everything fit, but I don't believe there is anything egregiously out of  place. For those who want to see all of the seeds broken down, here  they are...

mi7	flicks	1il4vjo	1739069436	Mission Impossible 2	"Revisiting the Mission Impossible franchise and have moved on the number 2

I had a total hatred for Tom Cruise in the 90’s and I could never really remember why. Then I put on Mission Impossible 2, perhaps the most self indulgent movie of all time. 

Here are my thoughts

The opening plane crash sequence wouldn’t be made in the post 9/11 world. I don’t think anyways. 

What a stupid fucking way to introduce Ethan in this movie. Free climbing by himself so he can do a 2 minute Oakley product placement. 


The smarmy introduction of Ethan and Thandie Newton’s character is straight up ripoff of 90’s Pierce Brosnan James Bond, as is Ethan sleeping with her and the car chase. The car chase is totally stolen from Goldeneye. And the lame dialogue before they go to bed is so lunkheaded it’s nauseating. As is the pillow talk. 

Ahh Anthony Hopkins. Maybe this will add some credibility to the film. 

James Bond does not fall in love this fast. One boinking and Ethan is ready to throw his life away is not very James Bond at all. 

James Bond does not brood over women either. 

Those are some badass shots of Sydney Harbour. 

Ooh I wonder how expensive that sea side house is. 

I love how 1998 was the year they tried to figure out how to make pulling data up on a computer and looking at surveillance footage exciting (see also Armageddon and Enemy of the State)

John Woo slow mo is the primary reason I’m not really a fan. Hard Tarbet being the most egregious offender. 

So I guess we’re just supposed to accept that this IMF agent is now the bad guy just cuz they tell us he is. 

Oh the bad dialogue “what are you going to do spank me?”

John Woo’s having a little too much fun with the mask idea. 

Okay the entry into Biocyte was pretty badass 

I keep checking how much time is left I’m not particularly invested in any of these characters but I’ll stick it out until the end. 

So this helicopter is just gonna hover over the building for like 20 mins and nobody is gonna notice. 

Oh I remember this stylized gun fighting looks kind of cool but totally ineffective. 

Ugh I can’t do it I’ve got 45 mins left and I can’t sit through that. I’m out

All in all a truly terrible movie that is even worse than I remember."	/r/flicks/comments/1il4vjo/mission_impossible_2/	https://www.reddit.com/r/flicks/comments/1il4vjo/mission_impossible_2/	
mi7	movies	1kuy64g	1748163780	Ocean’s 11 is closer to the MIssion Impossible TV show than the films ever were.	"I remember watching the original mission impossible when it came out and thought it was good but it was missing the team element and more about Tom Cruise. 8 films on and that has never changed.

The team dynamic in Ocean’s 11 was fun and sparked the thought the spirit of the MI TV show is much better depicted in that than Tom Cruise’s output.

Anyone else think they should emphasise the team dynamic and the long con/heist going forward once Cruise leaves the building?"	/r/movies/comments/1kuy64g/oceans_11_is_closer_to_the_mission_impossible_tv/	https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1kuy64g/oceans_11_is_closer_to_the_mission_impossible_tv/

barbie	TrueFilm	159vfdf	1690345686	Individualism and Barbie (2023)	"This is easily as much ""lore"" or my experience of playing with the dolls as a child, but the fundamental tradeoff Barbie offers in exchange for ""empowerment"" is a loss of individuality. Barbie can be anything, and Barbie is everything, but the hat trick that lets Barbie be a doctor and an astronaut and a mom and not a mom and President and and and is that the Barbie which does any of these particular accomplishments is not the same ""individual"" that accomplishes another. The fact that some ""other"" Barbie accomplished something has to be enough for every Barbie. I think this core concept of Barbieland is really fundamental to a lot of where the writing struggled in this movie and also to probably the most fundamental critique I have of the brand.

There are no individuals in Barbieland. Ken talks about this a bit when he talks about ""but it's Barbie and Ken, there is no just Ken."" He is ultimately an accessory to her just like her house and her car and her clothes are. His plot-convenient level of agency (and lack thereof) ultimately needs to be hand-waved away as too weak or well-meant for him to face the consequences of any of the scary psycho stuff he does, he needs to be forgiven so that at the end they can continue to be codependent accessories to each other.

The movie alluded to the significance of individuality in the real world in a few places. It talked about how real people only have one ending, but how ""Barbie"" can be anything. You'll also notice how a lot of the advice the Barbies gave each other that snapped them out of their brainwashing was around how to relate to other distinct people and the expectations and baggage they place on you.

Ultimately Barbieland can not have individuals and still be compromise-free. If somebody else accomplishing something isn't as good as you accomplishing it yourself, the choices of how you spend your time matter. More critically, when there are individuals in this world there has to be compromise between them. The movie (very reasonably) doesn't seem ready to unpack the fraught intersection of femininity and the expectation of compromise.

Unfortunately, I think the way the movie settled on two conflicting ideas about individuality is a lot of what made the ending feel so strange and disjointed. On the one hand, individuality was ultimately not necessary to solve the problems of Barbieland (the weird coordinated million dates being mean at once thing is very anti-individualism). On the other, Sterotypical Barbie still desires to become an individual by becoming a human. I think an ending with a more expressly coherent view of the desirability of individuality would have been more satisfying."	/r/TrueFilm/comments/159vfdf/individualism_and_barbie_2023/	https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/159vfdf/individualism_and_barbie_2023/

I KNOW I watched this. I remember Tom Cruise doing impossible stunts, I remember thinking it was a solid action flick,but if someone asked me to explain what the actual plot was or what the ""Rogue Nation"" even refers to, I'd be completely stumped. It's like it was deleted from my brain.

mi7	flicks	1555e1k	1689892083	I think Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning would have been better had they not revealed so much about the antagonist so early on in the film (spoilers)	"And by that I mean, I don't think they should have revealed ""the entity"" was an artificial intelligence program so early on. 

That scene in the government conference room was the only scene I really did not like because it was all of the various advisors explaining, in great detail, what the entity was, what it could do, what it had already done, and what it could be used for. That totally killed any and all mystery or mystique around the entity. 

There were so many scenes after that where I kept thinking to myself that it would have been cooler if I didn't know exactly what the entity was (sort of like the rabbit's foot in MI3). That would have left me guessing that it was maybe the codename for a cult or cyberterrorist group rather before eventually revealing it was an AI. I think that would have been better than dumping all of that information right at the beginning of the movie. I also think that, emotionally, the story would have been more compelling had it been Ethan Hunt slowly realizing that the thing he's going after is far more advanced than he ever thought possible. 

Part of me thinks this actually *was* the original intention of the story but someone higher up thought that audiences would be too dumb to understand it and shoehorned the explanation in early on."	/r/flicks/comments/1555e1k/i_think_mission_impossible_dead_reckoning_would/	https://www.reddit.com/r/flicks/comments/1555e1k/i_think_mission_impossible_dead_reckoning_would/

"The question isn't so much how do you like movies so far this decade, what did you think was good or not bad. I want this discussion to be more about your thoughts and reflections on the films and how they've been so far in terms of styles and perhaps themes and messages. 

Like how the cinematography is, the kinds of stories we're seeing and the writing style, maybe even the types of characters? In different genres? 

From big blockbusters like Top Gun: Maverick, Oppenheimer, Barbie, to surprise hits like Everything Everywhere All At Once; noteworthy international films like The Worst Person in the World and Anatomy of a Fall; horror films such as Pearl and Talk To Me. 

Every decade of films have a certain 'something' about them, that separate them from other decades and eras. 
Thematically, cinematically, and story-wise, do you notice anything about the 2020s in particular so far that stand out, or maybe there's ""more of"" than before?

barbie	TrueFilm	16ae42p	1693887901	Where Barbie Missed the Mark	"Having heard good things about Barbie, I decided to give a chance, and while it certain wasn't the worst film, I found myself ultimately disappointed. 

* The rules of the world made little sense, how was Ken able to brainwash all these smart Barbies into being subservient woman in a day? And why was America's character rant, effective at snapping this back, especially since it was about issues that they the Barbie's had never actually endured first hand? Barbie's naivety to real world woman's issues was explicitly pointed out by Margot Robbie's Barbie shock at how the real world worked, so the film is contracting itself.

* Were the Kens supposed to be an analogy to woman in the real world? Because they're almost entirely portrayed as stupid and silly throughout the entire movie.

* The motivation of America's character is bizarre, first the movie makes it seems like it's her relationship with her daughter, which is understanble as her daughter seems like a brat, but her daughter snobbishness, and in fact her entire personality, is almost immediately dropped and she becomes a completely no name sidekick. 

* What was the main point of the movie? Was it how hard being a woman is? Because I find it weird that they use America, an attractive upper middle class married woman to show that. If their point was the difficulty of being a woman, why couldn't they have used an actually unattractive woman, or a woman who atleast didn't fit gender norms as a source of a sympathy."	/r/TrueFilm/comments/16ae42p/where_barbie_missed_the_mark/	https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/16ae42p/where_barbie_missed_the_mark/

I’m currently working on a short film project set in the 1650s New England, and I wanted to get advice on what type of soundscape (music wise) would be fitting for such a film. Is there a specific genre of music which would work? It doesn’t need to feel ‘strictly’ 100% of the time - I like the idea of something like Oppenheimer, which has a score that feels timeless and a bit anachronistic.

indiana_jones	movies	1beo042	1710430459	Movie franchises that should ABSOLUTELY be remade	"We hate reboots and remakes, my hot take is that a few of these DEFINITELY  need to be remade for the franchise to succeed.

**Jurassic Park**

Each movie has been a decrease in quality since the first, and while you may argue, no one can say Jurassic Park isn't the best one with a straight face. That said, I think it's due for a remake, making it more accurate to the original book, leaning into horror, modern CGI to bring the dinos to life, and dinosaur designs more akin to what we now know about them scientifically. This idea came to me when that audio clip went viral, of what T-Rexes really sounded like. It was so haunting and terrifying, I was like, ""Jurassic Park could've been ridiculously scary"".

**Star Wars**

It's all great, I love Star Wars, but each movie retcons the last, contradicts something from before, is out of order, leaves out a lot of really good yet cut material, either looks low-budget or CGI-infested, and makes questionable writing choices. Retell the story either with films or miniseries, casting new actors like Ewan McGregor or Donald Glover, adding eu elements or cut storylines, enhanced CGI and practical effects, starting a whole new continuity that doesn't replace the original films, but pays homage to and adds upon the originals.

**Indiana Jones**

Just kidding, Harrison Ford is to Indiana Jones as Jesus is to the Bible.

**Marvel Cinematic Universe**

I'll say it, it has gotten too big. They've rushed through storylines like World War Hulk and Civil War without fully realizing the original story's potential. New actors can fill iconic roles and take different perspectives on the characters; an Iron Man that struggles with addiction and fights more high-tech villains like an actual AIM or Whiplash, a Captain America that mostly has adventures in the 40s, battling Red Skull, Baron Zemo, or Zola, a Thor that's actually a dude with a magic stick, more like God of War. These are basic-ass takes but different perspectives on comic characters has been what has kept the comics alive. Plus the MCU has introduced the Netflix heroes, the X-Men movies and cartoon, the Fantastic Four, fucking Spider-Man, imagine if the Marvel movie universe started with these iconic heroes.

**The Hobbit**

The trilogy we got was messy and way more violent than the book was, make a cozy middle-earth movie for families, you cowards. I would also include LotR, but I could not imagine they'd make a better movie. The idea of expanding on side stories and additional lore in streaming shows is a good idea, despite the general consensus on Rings of Power.

**Terminator, Alien, Predator, etc.**

Most of these sci-fi franchises have notorious sequels and continuations, maybe starting from scratch would be a good way to right the wrongs of these franchises. These franchises also feature women in lead roles which is important to the industry and to modern culture right now.

Tell me your own hot takes and ideas for remakes. Good or bad movies can be remade, whether to improve upon the original or to tell the story from a new perspective. Bad remakes are pale imitations, lifeless cash grabs, or fail to approach the franchise from a new and interesting angle.

  
Edit: Fine, I'll add some lesser-known movies. Mario Bros. from the 90s, cool ideas that weren't appreciated. Arsenic and Old Lace, a fantastic movie that people would love today. Any 70s-90s animated movie that was overshadowed by Disney and ended up flopping. Early 2000s Disney that flopped hard. This Island Earth should be remade as an ironically dramatic comedy. Bring Shaq back for a Steel remake, make it the event of the century. Looney Toons in live action is a cool idea that kinda sucked three times as long as you don't acknowledge nostalgia. The Incredible Shrinking Man was existential and terrifying, a story of a man slowly descending into nothingness. The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen had the coolest ideas but the shittiest execution. Santa Claus Conquers the Martians, hilarious concept. Mac and Me starring Paul Rudd."	/r/movies/comments/1beo042/movie_franchises_that_should_absolutely_be_remade/	https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1beo042/movie_franchises_that_should_absolutely_be_remade/	
barbie	TrueFilm	1glrl2b	1730989419	Where did Barbie (2023) go wrong in its narrative?	"Barbie, as we all know, is a part of the massive pop culture phenomenon 'Barbenheimer' and performed phenomenally well at the box office, as expected. 

It’s certainly one of the good comedies that grapple with delicate issues like feminism, patriarchy, consumerism, and materialism (yes, it tackles a lot). Most of all, it centers around an existential crisis, which defines the film and leads its characters on a journey of self-discovery to embrace their true selves, seek their spark, and find a purpose that makes life fulfilling, one for which they 'should be grateful.' 

At least, that’s how I interpreted it. The film offers a powerful message not just about 'feminism or patriarchy,' but about 'self-exploration,' which I believe is the true essence of what Barbie is trying to convey.

But if the film's intention is the former narrative, that's where it went wrong. I'll get back to it in a min.

That being said, I think, largely, this film benefits from practical sets, and a cartoonish approach that might not have made the film as special had they opted for computer graphics, which otherwise could have made Barbie as bland and far from a special film, to say the least. 

Margot Robbie is flawless as Barbie—I loved her character and her arc (the best part). And Ryan Gosling is sublime as Ken; he’s a total scene-stealer every time he’s on screen.

But where it went wrong? 

Well, I’d say it mostly has to do with the third act and how *Barbie* represents the real world in a way that’s not necessarily accurate and often feels like a straight-up cartoonish exaggeration. It paints society and institutions as being solely plagued by patriarchy, which itself feels goofy and sitcomish from the start.

Props to **tonal dissonance** within the film.

When you have a character expressing the agony she faces in patriarchal society, and she expects us to emphasize with her monologue, they MUST SHOW her actual misfortunes, her sufferings with her husband or any men in the film. 

But making her husband just a tool for comedy, Will Ferrell a total clown, and all the men in suits purely comic relief felt off. Even worse, the men running Mattel in *Barbie* are portrayed as so unserious. I mean, do you really look at them and think, 'Oh, they’re toxic and evil'? No, they just come across as a bunch of clowns in suits.

If that's your satirical view of misogynists to soften/comicize the toxic masculinity to fit within PG rating, and yet you expect us to emphasize with you, nah nah nah. It's conflicting with your narrative.

You can't expect audience to feel for the characters, 

""*when you can't even show the seriousness of subject that you're trying to deal with.*""

When it doesn't even take itself seriously, when that happens, a character cannot be emphasized with.

All that sermonizing monologue (a trope I dislike in films when a character spoon-feeds us/ lectures us literally), comes off a bit self-pity and overly preachy, beating us over the head.

It doesn't matter how things are in the real world, you have to ""show"" the toxic masculinity and actual patriarchy in the film, but not ""talk"" about it, but undress it and show the naked patriarchy. Cut to the short, I don't appreciate how Barbie violates ""Show, not tell"" filmmaking rule.

I don't know if it's an intentional creative choice to portray the entire real-world in a stereotypical approach, which is quite meta for the Barbie character story they're telling. Everything that Barbie &amp; Ken see in the real world is nothing but reduced to mere stereotypes.

I just wish Greta had taken more time to polish the third act that I feel may have hindered the film from being one of the best films lately. 

In the ending, I was left unsatisfied with things that have wound up in the film. It misses quite a brilliance that would have made Barbie a much more profoundly resonating film that would have left us with a feeling at the end that we just watched an extraordinary film, but it DIDN'T DO that for me. 

If Greta had taken a subtle, clever approach to convey toxic masculinity and patriarchy subliminally, added more depth to certain characters, and given more runtime to certain moments, rather than dealing scenes with heavy-handed, and squandering at unnecessary scenes, I'm sure this would have gone down as one of the best films in late times."	/r/TrueFilm/comments/1glrl2b/where_did_barbie_2023_go_wrong_in_its_narrative/	https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/1glrl2b/where_did_barbie_2023_go_wrong_in_its_narrative/

Everybody is all about how feminist it is and all, but I think it holds such a powerful message for men. It's Ken, he's all about desperately wanting Barbie's validation all the time but then develops so much and becomes 'kenough', as in, enough without female validation. He's got self-worth in himself, not just because a woman gave it to him.

To be specific the scenes in Long Legs where the empathic ability the main character has flashes scene of red with different satanic images such as a snake. 
Or the scene in Mad Max at 30:35 where he rises from the sand and scenes of orange and waves of almost fluid splash momentarily across the screen.
And the many scene of Oppenheimer displaying thing like strings, particles, and most of all the various scenes of ""fire""

indiana_jones	movies	1i9vode	1737835537	Indiana Jones was an homage to James Bond, so they cast Sean Connery as his father. What are other instances of homage casting?	"Was thinking about this. Spielberg and Lucas have long said that ""Indiana Jones"" was born from their desire to make a James Bond film, mixed with the 1930s action serials they also used to love. There's a bunch of James Bond castings in the Indiana Jones franchise - namely Sean Connery, but also Allison Doody and Julian Glover as well.

Another example is ""Joker"" taking cues from DeNiro films ""Taxi Driver"" and ""The King of Comedy,"" with them ultimately casting Robert DeNiro in their film as well.

What other examples exist of this? A movie inspires another movie, so they cast folks from that first movie in this one."	/r/movies/comments/1i9vode/indiana_jones_was_an_homage_to_james_bond_so_they/	https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1i9vode/indiana_jones_was_an_homage_to_james_bond_so_they/

indiana_jones	flicks	1hssbyu	1735926616	Looking Back On 2024 (A Cinematic Year in Review)	"As a preface, I will only list here what I watched during the past year, which includes the delayees (is that even a word) from 2023, movies moved to 2024 due to the idiotic distribution structure of my country. These include The Iron Claw, The Holdovers, Poor Things, May December, The Zone of Interest, The Boy and the Heron, Priscilla and the Anatomy of a Fall. Some others I didn’t get around to watch or haven’t heard of before 2024, like Sisu, Kiss The Girls or Mr. Holmes. With that out of the way, let’s get down to it!

34. Rebel Moon: A Child of Fire. No surprise here, but I still think it’s a half-decent movie. I mean, of course, most of the plot is claptrap (despite a couple good in-isolation scenes), the lore is established way too haphazardly for its own good and the cinematography doesn’t provide as much gravitas or atmosphere to the scenes as it thinks it is, but Snyder still manages to squeeze out some nice performances (in particular from Michiel Huisman and the delightfully malicious Ed Skrein as Admiral Atticus Noble). And the score by Junkie XL unironically SLAPS. It’s weighty, ethereal and immersive as fuck, especially everytime chorals and angry artificial howling - Noble’s theme - can be heard on the screen. It is ultimately due to the music that the movie is not a failure.

33. Godzilla X Kong: A New Empire. This one’s merit, on the other hand, lies exclusively in the visual spectacle. Here Holkenborg could not cook up something noteworthy, but the action carried hard. I mean, mostly because the Skar King and Shimo’s battle against G and K wore off pretty quickly. The human characters were uncompelling, the story presented no interesting themes, and the visuals I found pretty below average. It was just mediocre.

32. Rebel Moon: The Scargiver. A slight bump as far as overall cinematic quality is concerned. The cinematography offers something more visually enthralling, and this time Snyder’s time wasting pays off in a way. Holkenborg keeps the score quality intact, as is the case with Skrein’s performance. But the movie is still a haphazardly conceived mess of poorly constructed, bizarrely acting individuals I’ve little to no connection to. So, a miss.

31. Ferrari. I don’t have a whole lot to say about it, other than the faux-Italian accents were a definite miss, and everything aside from the racing scenes and Penelope Cruz’s performance was just uninteresting. But Cruz and the races carried hard, plain and simple. Still, a mediocre movie that fails to examine its protagonist.

30. Mr. Holmes. It was an overall interesting take on an older Holmes, with Ian McKellen turning in a memorable performance as both versions of the character. To me the film did a good job juggling three separate plotlines, all of which had some merit. All in all, a graceful portrayal of an aged hero that lost most things and people he cared about. For some it’ll certainly be more graceful than the fates of Indiana Jones, Han Solo and Luke Skywalker.

29. The Boy and the Heron. Compared to how praised it was… I was disappointed. Maybe it was just me getting to know Miyazaki for the first time for real. But interestingly enough, I found very little interesting content in the movie other than the animation itself and the Grey Heron. I sure felt for Mahito, but I didn’t get to know him a whole lot in a substantial way. Nor any other character, really. They were like silhouettes, just passing through the screen, mere figures pushing Mahito to the next plot point. And his grand-grand-grand uncle? A complete afterthought. I don’t even know why he created that fantastical world, and a minute of WW2 carnage coupled with a few throwaway lines about the world’s “wickedness” a theme make not, sadly. But it’s still a good movie.

28. The Beekeeper. I had a good time, despite a plot light on thematics and character, but loaded with an absurd amount of bee metaphors. Adam, Jason Statham’s character, was reasonably grounded with both ruthlessness for capitalist scammers and care for ordinary citizens. Add some nice visuals, twists and supporting performances and you got a good, if overall run-of-the-mill action flick.

27. Scent of a Woman. Yeah, I like it. Most of it boils down to a fucking tour de force performance by Al Pacino and character work related to his character, but he just makes it work, especially with the “I’ll show you OUT OF ORDER!” scene. I won’t elaborate any further.

26. Insurrectionist 1863. For the first time we venture into Poland to see a historical movie telling the story of Father Stanisław Brzóska’s involvement in the January Uprising of 1863. The priest himself aside, the characters weren’t too compelling, but Brzóska’s journey throughout the movie, especially his role as a priest evolving in the conflict, makes it all worth it. This is a piece of cinema hard carried by the protagonist.

25. Screw Mickiewicz. Once more a Polish film which will (most likely) only hit for you if you’re from the country like myself. But it was a genuinely hilarious and lively flick, with a lot of actual understanding of the teenage Poles’ mentality and some fairly emotional moments. Also, a really nice soundtrack assembled from the works of modern Polish rap and pop artists.

24. The Iron Claw. Another overrated - if nearly actually great - darling of 2023. Like with Miyazaki’s piece, I felt little emotional connection to the Von Erich brothers, the most belonging to David - who died first. The amount of bad shit happening in succession was also too much; it felt like, dare I say, misery porn at times. No interesting cinematography (save for the black ‘n’ white opening) or music either. But the movie did present a compelling story looking at the plot elements themselves, and Fritz Von Erich was a very well-realized character.

23. May December. The first proper great movie of the bunch. Maybe some more time should have been spent on dissecting the relationship between Melton’s Joe and Moore’s Gracie, but since the protagonist is a sensationalist, self-important bitch that doesn’t care about the people she’ll be portraying, that’s what we get. Speaking of which, Natalie Portman made the movie for me, it was like a female Kirk Lazarus performance, absolutely stunning. Technical side of things wise it didn’t wow me, but its examination of the subject matter is absolutely commendable.

22. Sisu. Holy crap, what a great action flick. A bunch of decently despicable Nazis against an endlessly adaptable Finnish vet/hermit. Some nice team work between him and the enslaved women in the end, enthralling action and the pure grit make for a great offering. Again, see it in case you have not!

21. Alien: Romulus. I never hated Covenant (I just thought the ending with le bad guy David winning was stupid, which was understandable given the fact I was 14 back then and didn’t truly recognize the merit of bleaker closures in cinema), so I didn’t expect Romulus to be a “return to form”, but its upholding, which it was. Cailee Spaeny once again smashed the hell out of her role, nailing her more relaxed and tense scenes a like. She is also able to just… appear and act genuinely likeable, she makes for a rootable protagonist, y’know? Another standout is David Jonsson, playing an android like he was Paul Bettany or goddamn Michael Fassbender himself. Ian Holm’s undead appearance is irksome, sure, but they managed to disguise it well enough for me not to detect it until after I delved into the discourse. The horror of the aliens? On point. Atmosphere? Impeccable. Visuals? Breathtaking.

20. Rebel Ridge. This one is a milder offering spectacle and politics wise compared to the ones that come after it in the list, but it’s a worthy watch. The opener alone is a powerful one, and while perhaps not entirely accurate to how these things would go down, it gave me a good idea of the possible ways American cops abuse their authority, especially in regards to black people. And it’s consistently great throughout, especially with its execution of the non-killing protagonist.

19. Kiss The Girls. It’s an older one, but it checks out. I especially appreciate the sheer terror of the Casanova, both pre and post-reveal. Morgan Freeman, Cary Elwes and Ashley Judd all crushed their roles. But this won’t do the movie any justice… If you haven’t seen it for yourself, do it.

18. Furiosa. As far as prequels go, this one’s neat. Important info regarding the Mad Max world is there, coupled with brilliant performances by Anya Taylor-Joy (how the hell did she manage to emulate Charlize this well?! HOW?!) and Chris Hemsworth, who, channeling his inner Thor, puts a MadMaxesque spin on it, adding a layer of post-apocalyptic internal hollowness and insatiable, self-fueling cruelty and hatred, bred by some terrible trauma, not unlike Furiosa’s (or Thor’s, for that matter). I suppose that’s the main merit of the movie, the ways in which they mirror each other. Which makes their final scene together a fucking standout. Also, pay attention to the History Man: George Shevtsov is fantastic in the role, and occasionally he drops Thanos-level banger lines, adding both philosophical ideas and vulnerability to the story.

17. Joker: Folie à Deux. Likely the most controversial take, but I love this movie. It takes the well-known story from 2019, puts it in a new setting and makes the most of it. I was especially stoked once I realized the musical inserts were fantasies, extensions of Arthur and Harley’s desires, fears and wishes. The score provided a nice layer of gloominess to the whole, the cinematography was jaw-dropping, and I can’t help but find the conclusion… fitting. Like many others have said before me: it wasn’t about the Clown Prince of Crime. It was about a marginalized man who inadvertently became a symbol and an outlet for disillusioned citizens to embody their own fear and anger, only to be hated, rejected and forgotten once he declared he shared their fear and anger no longer. A beautiful deconstruction.

16. Scarborn. Another Polish film, but this time it’s a historical action flick. Centered around the Kościuszko Insurrection of 1794 it provides a pretty immersive piece of historical fiction centered around how said Insurrection came to be. Wait through the lengthy build up and the final act will wow you with Tarantino-esque tension and spectacle. Some fantastic cinematography, too!

15. Anora. This hurts me the most, because I believe it’s an impressive offering, but lacks “the sauce”. As great as Mikey Madison was as Anora, as believable as the world and characters around her were, I found insufficient amounts of context to care about her as much as Baker wanted me to. How fucking sad it is that I found TOROS, the main henchman character more interesting and entertaining to watch than her? Didn’t help that Baker couldn’t find the right tone for several scenes, especially the supposedly serious ones overloaded with comedic inserts… But his direction, especially the camera movement was without a doubt a true show of skill, and I cannot find any fault in the cinematography and non-lead performances either.

14. Wrooklyn Zoo. Yet another Polish movie in the mix, and most likely the most special one. It’s about Poland’s modern problems, the virtues and sins of the old and the youth and the absolutely amazing yet painful feeling that is love. While I don’t think our protagonists were amazing characters and the final act relies on a bit of resurrectionist Hollywood bullshit, the movie drips with style, heart and distinct energy that’s hard to put into words. Also, the pacing was fantastic. Made it seem like a movie of twice its length yet endlessly captivating.

13. Civil War. My introduction to Alex Garland, and what an introduction that was! My most favorite thing about it is just how hard it drills into the conflict between journalistic integrity and the pervasive sensationalist nature of the job, especially in America. Every single main character felt like a real person with their own ideas and priorities, everyone embodied their characters to a fault, and I could only watch with wonder and horror as their lives and jobs turned to shit due to the eponymous conflict. The final third is as captivating as it is devastating and can really make you think about the possibility of objective, well-intentioned documentation of tragedies.

12. The Holdovers. Maybe the most wholesome and hilarious thing I saw in 2024. Along the incredible, sharp performances by Paul Giamatti, Dominic Sessa and Da’Vine Joy Randolph wraps Alexander Payne’s whimsical yet touching screenplay. It’s a movie that understands the bitter, but at the same time shows them their current state of being doesn’t have to be what defines their life or gives it purpose.

11. Carry-On. I expected it to be a somewhat interesting execution of a promising premise. But man oh MAN, I was not prepared to witness the absolute CINEMA of it all, not at all! Everyone from Edgerton to Bateman is on their A game, the protagonist and the antagonists constantly outsmarting each other makes for an endlessly tense and riveting dynamic, and even the themes themselves present some interesting commentary about military subcontractors, arms deals and the boogeyman of Russian threat to America.

10. Poor Things. The VERY dodgy implications of what is being done to Bella and the unnecessary POV shift from the source material aside, this was a sublime introduction to Lanthimos. Whatever the scene called for, the man and his crew were more than up for the task. Tension, wonder, elation, terror, despair, hopelessness, cynicism, fulfillment, whimsy… all conveyed with a weirdness I suppose is uniquely his. Also, BRAVO to Jerskin Fendrix for that score. Bizarre yet utterly enthralling in how intrusive and odd it is. And to Emma Stone, who can like no other portray a determined, stoically wisecracking British woman.

9. The A(A)-Team. The final Polish offering. I did not expect to love it as much as I did. But when you get a bunch of terribly scarred yet well-meaning people trying to atone for what they did as alcoholics, a plot that combines the whackier sides of Poland and a very emotional main goal, with vibes and directorial style that keeps you glued to the screen no matter what, you get pretty good fucking cinema. My personal standouts are the little monochrome pencil-driven flashback animations that, combined with the protagonists’ voiceover, explain the mistakes they made and the pain they caused.

8. Priscilla. Cailee Spaeny should’ve been nominated for this, no doubt. She is as believable as her character at 14 as she is at 25. Her ability to transition between ages was just phenomenal. Make up team, Jacob Elordi and Sofia Coppola also deserve genuine praise. But my biggest praise for the film lies in the fact that it managed to make a great story without creating a narrative centered around a specific endeavor or event. It’s just a collection of connected events, yet each of them reveals something interesting about the characters or the world they inhabit.

7. Anatomy of a Fall. Probably the most down-to-earth film in the group. It leaves you with a lack of closure, a feeling of strong ambiguity and uncertainty. Which I suppose was the directorial intent. Great performances from everyone (though the one I’d nominate Sandra Hüller for was in Glazer’s, not Triet’s movie), a compelling mystery, and the courtroom scenes… Oh, they were a fucking blast. It was like watching a dead-serious, prosaic, more sincere version of Ace Attorney. Just as much entertainment and dynamism in the scenes, but without AA’s crazy energy. Best hallmarks of the movie’s quality are the fact I could only nitpick the slightly underwhelming cinematography and the grating 50 Cent track.

6. Speak No Evil. You’re probably surprised to see it up here, but I’mma own it. Not only does Speak No Evil use its vague premise to create a ticking bomb of a plot that once goes off, it fucking TEARS the screen to shreds. After that, it also becomes a fucking MASTERCLASS in tension, my whole body was there ready to give out any minute once our protagonists realized the deep shit they were in. Special accolades to James McAvoy, Mackenzie Davis and Scoot McNairy as far as performances go. There are also some well-conveyed themes about generational trauma poisoning people’s souls, the dangers of the inability to say “no” and the depths some will go to justify their actions. Fantastic filmmaking.

5. The Apprentice. I have to applaud Ali Abbasi for managing to keep the story infused with the typical Trumpian undertones of vanity, hedonism and rapaciousness and not losing the emotion in it. The movie forges the spear of depressive truths about Trump’s world and stabs you with it repeatedly. But eventually, the stab just hurts you somewhere lower, existentially. You don’t even feel for Donald anymore, if you ever did in the first place. All that’s left is Roy and Ivana, and they’re both royally screwed. As is America, if the final shot and real life are anything to go by. But hey, at least we got a three-composer-collaboration of a score that is both cohesive and fucking excellent in quality. How about that? (Nominate Dirkov, Holmes and Irvine for the Oscar, you COWARDS!)

4. Conclave. The one movie where my firm expectations regarding its quality were thoroughly fulfilled. When you look at it as a whole, you may come to a conclusion it’s like Oppenheimer, but in a church setting. I mean, I sure did get the impression, considering the sharp, visually clean and orderly directing/editing style, the rhythmically oppressive yet graceful score and the raw yet elegant acting of the performers involved. Fiennes earned his Best Actor nom, no doubt, but I’m secretly hoping for a Best Supporting nom for Carlos Diehz as Vincent Benítez. He sold the man’s honesty, kindness and timidness with such conviction I only doubted it due to a fakeout Berger planted last minute. As far as their characters’ innocence goes, this year only Cailee Spaeny matched Diehz. The movie plays like a purebred conspiracy thriller, questioning everyone’s motives, infusing paranoia and uncertainty into every scene. You have ZERO fucking confusion about the extent to which the Holy See lost its way, because certain frames just scream “This can’t be made right, can IT?!” But the movie’s true genius lies in its twist, because it reframes both the movie’s themes and characters in ways never explicitly stated, yet hard-hitting once inferred. This would’ve been a masterpiece had the secondary antagonist been more fleshed out.

3. Dune Part 2. Denis Villeneuve and Greg Fraser ain’t skipped a single goddamn beat on the production. Hans Zimmer did, but even with more repetition his musical material is top-notch. The movie sure takes a while to get going, but I have nothing but applause for it for how effectively it establishes its antagonist (really crappy how they did very little with him in the end, though), and how the Harkonnenian clusterfuck on Arrakis beautifully falls apart with time. When Paul ascends to Prophet level and goes sicko mode on the establishment, the movie kicks into its highest gear on all levels. We understand everyone’s position in the conflict and what they’re willing to do to achieve their goals. Which makes it so frustrating Emperor Shaddam and Feyd-Rautha do not get nearly enough time to have their political and philosophical perspectives be expressed. But still, the movie is lethally efficient when it comes to… Chani and her disillusionment arc. Not only is she an excellent mirror to the bloodthirsty Gurney and the increasingly fanatical Stilgar, Zendaya turns in some incredibly believable acting that had me rooting for her with no questions. I can’t wait for Messiah, and Shai-Hulud bless Villeneuve’s team!

2. The Zone of Interest. That movie hits on a deeper level. I did not actually comprehend what I saw until I was back home from the theater, and that’s when I started crying. The movie is indeed viciously effective in how much it can tear your heart out without you seeing or realizing it in the first place. Insanely beautiful cinematography, and the score… 3 tracks in the whole movie, yet they’re all fucking Oscar-worthy. Great acting. And the theme of invisibility… it’s clear enough you know what’s the context Glazer applies it to, but also subtle enough everyone will have ideas about what it means to say and which other contexts it can be applied to in real life. Probably the best candidate for 2023’s BP barring Oppenheimer.

1. The Substance. If The Zone of Interest is bold, then Coralie Fargeat’s project is BOLD. Not really in its theme, but in how it’s executed. It’s an attack on the senses, in both a good and bad way. The screen sucks you in and shits you out time and time again. You’re in an abusive relationship with it, just like Liz Sparkle is with The Substance/Sue. Huge props for the trailer, because it fooled me so hard into thinking we’d be getting an individual v individuals/society conflict, while we got an individual v self conflict. I was watching with all my interest as Liz and Sue tried to undermine each other yet being constantly forced to rely on one another, as the situation got worse and worse. It’s not that a person is trying to destroy themself, it’s how extreme the degradation is. The movie knows no fucking restraint sometimes, and in those times the terror can be mixed with perverse glee and karmic satisfaction, gives those times coincide with character punishment, but when it manages to show restraint, the horror stings more profoundly. In 2024 few things in cinema managed to scare the crap out of me, and one of them was Sue smiling hysterically to a mirror as several of her teeth were falling out. The Substance thrives in the hateful and the loving, the gross and the tantalizing, the sinister and the kind. At its heart it’s a story of a woman who could not forgive herself for something she had no control over. You really see it in 3 scenes only, but those 3 scenes are what’s enough to make the movie sincere. Moore and Qualley are insanely convincing. God! Just give it the BP already!

All in all, a great year. I won’t say it’s superior to 2023 or anything, but I think I’d rate The Substance on the same level as Babylon (a delayee from 2022 that topped the 2023 chart), which I suppose is saying something. But now I know one thing for sure. Cinema has become something I’ll probably love forever."	/r/flicks/comments/1hssbyu/looking_back_on_2024_a_cinematic_year_in_review/	https://www.reddit.com/r/flicks/comments/1hssbyu/looking_back_on_2024_a_cinematic_year_in_review/	
oppenheimer	flicks	1hssbyu	1735926616	Looking Back On 2024 (A Cinematic Year in Review)	"As a preface, I will only list here what I watched during the past year, which includes the delayees (is that even a word) from 2023, movies moved to 2024 due to the idiotic distribution structure of my country. These include The Iron Claw, The Holdovers, Poor Things, May December, The Zone of Interest, The Boy and the Heron, Priscilla and the Anatomy of a Fall. Some others I didn’t get around to watch or haven’t heard of before 2024, like Sisu, Kiss The Girls or Mr. Holmes. With that out of the way, let’s get down to it!

34. Rebel Moon: A Child of Fire. No surprise here, but I still think it’s a half-decent movie. I mean, of course, most of the plot is claptrap (despite a couple good in-isolation scenes), the lore is established way too haphazardly for its own good and the cinematography doesn’t provide as much gravitas or atmosphere to the scenes as it thinks it is, but Snyder still manages to squeeze out some nice performances (in particular from Michiel Huisman and the delightfully malicious Ed Skrein as Admiral Atticus Noble). And the score by Junkie XL unironically SLAPS. It’s weighty, ethereal and immersive as fuck, especially everytime chorals and angry artificial howling - Noble’s theme - can be heard on the screen. It is ultimately due to the music that the movie is not a failure.

33. Godzilla X Kong: A New Empire. This one’s merit, on the other hand, lies exclusively in the visual spectacle. Here Holkenborg could not cook up something noteworthy, but the action carried hard. I mean, mostly because the Skar King and Shimo’s battle against G and K wore off pretty quickly. The human characters were uncompelling, the story presented no interesting themes, and the visuals I found pretty below average. It was just mediocre.

32. Rebel Moon: The Scargiver. A slight bump as far as overall cinematic quality is concerned. The cinematography offers something more visually enthralling, and this time Snyder’s time wasting pays off in a way. Holkenborg keeps the score quality intact, as is the case with Skrein’s performance. But the movie is still a haphazardly conceived mess of poorly constructed, bizarrely acting individuals I’ve little to no connection to. So, a miss.

31. Ferrari. I don’t have a whole lot to say about it, other than the faux-Italian accents were a definite miss, and everything aside from the racing scenes and Penelope Cruz’s performance was just uninteresting. But Cruz and the races carried hard, plain and simple. Still, a mediocre movie that fails to examine its protagonist.

30. Mr. Holmes. It was an overall interesting take on an older Holmes, with Ian McKellen turning in a memorable performance as both versions of the character. To me the film did a good job juggling three separate plotlines, all of which had some merit. All in all, a graceful portrayal of an aged hero that lost most things and people he cared about. For some it’ll certainly be more graceful than the fates of Indiana Jones, Han Solo and Luke Skywalker.

29. The Boy and the Heron. Compared to how praised it was… I was disappointed. Maybe it was just me getting to know Miyazaki for the first time for real. But interestingly enough, I found very little interesting content in the movie other than the animation itself and the Grey Heron. I sure felt for Mahito, but I didn’t get to know him a whole lot in a substantial way. Nor any other character, really. They were like silhouettes, just passing through the screen, mere figures pushing Mahito to the next plot point. And his grand-grand-grand uncle? A complete afterthought. I don’t even know why he created that fantastical world, and a minute of WW2 carnage coupled with a few throwaway lines about the world’s “wickedness” a theme make not, sadly. But it’s still a good movie.

28. The Beekeeper. I had a good time, despite a plot light on thematics and character, but loaded with an absurd amount of bee metaphors. Adam, Jason Statham’s character, was reasonably grounded with both ruthlessness for capitalist scammers and care for ordinary citizens. Add some nice visuals, twists and supporting performances and you got a good, if overall run-of-the-mill action flick.

27. Scent of a Woman. Yeah, I like it. Most of it boils down to a fucking tour de force performance by Al Pacino and character work related to his character, but he just makes it work, especially with the “I’ll show you OUT OF ORDER!” scene. I won’t elaborate any further.

Like many others have said before me: it wasn’t about the Clown Prince of Crime.

Whatever the scene called for, the man and his crew were more than up for the task. Tension, wonder, elation, terror, despair, hopelessness, cynicism, fulfillment, whimsy… all conveyed with a weirdness I suppose is uniquely his. Also, BRAVO to Jerskin Fendrix for that score. Bizarre yet utterly enthralling in how intrusive and odd it is. And to Emma Stone, who can like no other portray a determined, stoically wisecracking British woman.

Which I suppose was the directorial intent. Great performances from everyone (though the one I’d nominate Sandra Hüller for was in Glazer’s, not Triet’s movie), a compelling mystery, and the courtroom scenes… Oh, they were a fucking blast. It was like watching a dead-serious, prosaic, more sincere version of Ace Attorney. Just as much entertainment and dynamism in the scenes, but without AA’s crazy energy. Best hallmarks of the movie’s quality are the fact I could only nitpick the slightly underwhelming cinematography and the grating 50 Cent track.

6. Speak No Evil. You’re probably surprised to see it up here, but I’mma own it. Not only does Speak No Evil use its vague premise to create a ticking bomb of a plot that once goes off, it fucking TEARS the screen to shreds. After that, it also becomes a fucking MASTERCLASS in tension, my whole body was there ready to give out any minute once our protagonists realized the deep shit they were in. Special accolades to James McAvoy, Mackenzie Davis and Scoot McNairy as far as performances go. There are also some well-conveyed themes about generational trauma poisoning people’s souls, the dangers of the inability to say “no” and the depths some will go to justify their actions. Fantastic filmmaking.

5. The Apprentice. I have to applaud Ali Abbasi for managing to keep the story infused with the typical Trumpian undertones of vanity, hedonism and rapaciousness and not losing the emotion in it. The movie forges the spear of depressive truths about Trump’s world and stabs you with it repeatedly. But eventually, the stab just hurts you somewhere lower, existentially. You don’t even feel for Donald anymore, if you ever did in the first place. All that’s left is Roy and Ivana, and they’re both royally screwed. As is America, if the final shot and real life are anything to go by. But hey, at least we got a three-composer-collaboration of a score that is both cohesive and fucking excellent in quality. How about that? (Nominate Dirkov, Holmes and Irvine for the Oscar, you COWARDS!)

4. Conclave. The one movie where my firm expectations regarding its quality were thoroughly fulfilled. When you look at it as a whole, you may come to a conclusion it’s like Oppenheimer, but in a church setting. I mean, I sure did get the impression, considering the sharp, visually clean and orderly directing/editing style, the rhythmically oppressive yet graceful score and the raw yet elegant acting of the performers involved. Fiennes earned his Best Actor nom, no doubt, but I’m secretly hoping for a Best Supporting nom for Carlos Diehz as Vincent Benítez. He sold the man’s honesty, kindness and timidness with such conviction I only doubted it due to a fakeout Berger planted last minute. As far as their characters’ innocence goes, this year only Cailee Spaeny matched Diehz. The movie plays like a purebred conspiracy thriller, questioning everyone’s motives, infusing paranoia and uncertainty into every scene. You have ZERO fucking confusion about the extent to which the Holy See lost its way, because certain frames just scream “This can’t be made right, can IT?!” But the movie’s true genius lies in its twist, because it reframes both the movie’s themes and characters in ways never explicitly stated, yet hard-hitting once inferred. This would’ve been a masterpiece had the secondary antagonist been more fleshed out.

3. Dune Part 2. Denis Villeneuve and Greg Fraser ain’t skipped a single goddamn beat on the production. Hans Zimmer did, but even with more repetition his musical material is top-notch. The movie sure takes a while to get going, but I have nothing but applause for it for how effectively it establishes its antagonist (really crappy how they did very little with him in the end, though), and how the Harkonnenian clusterfuck on Arrakis beautifully falls apart with time. When Paul ascends to Prophet level and goes sicko mode on the establishment, the movie kicks into its highest gear on all levels. We understand everyone’s position in the conflict and what they’re willing to do to achieve their goals. Which makes it so frustrating Emperor Shaddam and Feyd-Rautha do not get nearly enough time to have their political and philosophical perspectives be expressed. But still, the movie is lethally efficient when it comes to… Chani and her disillusionment arc. Not only is she an excellent mirror to the bloodthirsty Gurney and the increasingly fanatical Stilgar, Zendaya turns in some incredibly believable acting that had me rooting for her with no questions. I can’t wait for Messiah, and Shai-Hulud bless Villeneuve’s team!

2. The Zone of Interest. That movie hits on a deeper level. I did not actually comprehend what I saw until I was back home from the theater, and that’s when I started crying. The movie is indeed viciously effective in how much it can tear your heart out without you seeing or realizing it in the first place. Insanely beautiful cinematography, and the score… 3 tracks in the whole movie, yet they’re all fucking Oscar-worthy. Great acting. And the theme of invisibility… it’s clear enough you know what’s the context Glazer applies it to, but also subtle enough everyone will have ideas about what it means to say and which other contexts it can be applied to in real life. Probably the best candidate for 2023’s BP barring Oppenheimer.

1. The Substance. If The Zone of Interest is bold, then Coralie Fargeat’s project is BOLD. Not really in its theme, but in how it’s executed. It’s an attack on the senses, in both a good and bad way. The screen sucks you in and shits you out time and time again. You’re in an abusive relationship with it, just like Liz Sparkle is with The Substance/Sue. Huge props for the trailer, because it fooled me so hard into thinking we’d be getting an individual v individuals/society conflict, while we got an individual v self conflict. I was watching with all my interest as Liz and Sue tried to undermine each other yet being constantly forced to rely on one another, as the situation got worse and worse. It’s not that a person is trying to destroy themself, it’s how extreme the degradation is. The movie knows no fucking restraint sometimes, and in those times the terror can be mixed with perverse glee and karmic satisfaction, gives those times coincide with character punishment, but when it manages to show restraint, the horror stings more profoundly. In 2024 few things in cinema managed to scare the crap out of me, and one of them was Sue smiling hysterically to a mirror as several of her teeth were falling out. The Substance thrives in the hateful and the loving, the gross and the tantalizing, the sinister and the kind. At its heart it’s a story of a woman who could not forgive herself for something she had no control over. You really see it in 3 scenes only, but those 3 scenes are what’s enough to make the movie sincere. Moore and Qualley are insanely convincing. God! Just give it the BP already!

All in all, a great year. I won’t say it’s superior to 2023 or anything, but I think I’d rate The Substance on the same level as Babylon (a delayee from 2022 that topped the 2023 chart), which I suppose is saying something. But now I know one thing for sure. Cinema has become something I’ll probably love forever."	/r/flicks/comments/1hssbyu/looking_back_on_2024_a_cinematic_year_in_review/	https://www.reddit.com/r/flicks/comments/1hssbyu/looking_back_on_2024_a_cinematic_year_in_review/	
barbie	movies	1gosvwj	1731333786	I've watched almost 200 unseen movies as part of a weekly challenge for myself. What should be my 200th movie?	"Since April 2021, I've engaged in a personal challenge where once a week I watch one film I haven't watched before; an unseen movie. It can be a newly released film or it can be decades old; it just has to be one I haven't watched yet. I've watched plenty of films before doing this and honestly my number of total films I've watched is probably closer to 500 at least.

But anyway, sometime in December I will be watching my 200th film as part of my weekly challenge. My problem is that I want it to be a really good film to celebrate doing this for almost 200 weeks (It's probably more like 195 weeks but whatever). My 100th film was Good Will Hunting, which was probably one of the best films I watched in 2023, so I'm looking for something along the lines of that in terms of a classic movie.

So with all that in mind, what you recommend be my 200th film?

I have a list of all the films I've watched as part of my challenge, which is fairly diversified. I said my total film count is higher but just assume these are the only ones I've watched. Or if you want, make an educated guess at what films I've already seen based on the list.

mi7	flicks	1c9kszu	1713713730	What’s a director that you’ve given up for after watching one of their movies?	"Maybe it was a long time coming after multiple movies left you feeling disappointed. Perhaps it was the first movie of theirs you happened to watch that just made you think they will never be for me. 

I have two maybe controversial picks. Mission impossible 2. John Woo is just not for me. It’s the only one of his I’ve watched and I do not intend to watch more of them. No disrespect to fans of the director and I’m sure his other movies are great but I genuinely couldn’t stand a single thing about this movie. 

My second is Wes Anderson after Asteroid city. I love him as a creator and I’m glad he hasn’t felt the push to be even more accessible. The royal Tenenbaums and fantastic Mr fox might be two of my favourite movies of all time. With a shout out to the grand Budapest hotel. Watching Asteroid city made me think about all the times my friends and family who just couldn’t get into Andersons movies I finally understood it. It’s his most self indulgent movie imo and for me personally was really emotionally hollow. 

Try and be respectful please. Remember it’s just a discussion on subjective opinions. 

Edit. I’ll add another director I’ve written off is James Wan. I initially liked him with the conjuring but every movie I watched after soured my view of his style. Malignant almost made me give up on him but after watching Saw I told myself never again. I love horror as a genre and had high hopes but while the writing of the movie bothered me the direction pushed it over the edge for me. 

And I hear a lot of comments saying I shouldn’t judge him on his worst movie and that’s fair. While hard target and face off are non starters to me because of the cast. I will at least attempt the killers which I’ve seen a fair few people recommend now."	/r/flicks/comments/1c9kszu/whats_a_director_that_youve_given_up_for_after/	https://www.reddit.com/r/flicks/comments/1c9kszu/whats_a_director_that_youve_given_up_for_after/	
oppenheimer	TrueFilm	15dmmld	1690726408	Dancer in the Dark (2000) film review - an analysis of von Trier's tour de force	"I want to preface this post by saying that yes, I have seen Oppenheimer, and yes, I have seen Barbie, and no, I will not be discussing either (at least not right now haha). Instead, I will be discussing what is probably my second favourite film by my favourite director. If you have not yet had the pleasure of watching 'Dancer in the Dark' please do. I will keep this excerpt of my review/analysis **spoiler free** for that purpose.

In his award-winning musical drama ‘Dancer in the Dark’, Lars von Trier depicts Czech immigrant factory worker Selma, whose sight is rapidly deteriorating. As Selma undergoes struggles in her life, she escapes increasingly often into musical daydreams. ‘Dancer in the Dark’ is the final film in von Trier’s ‘Golden Heart Trilogy’, and explores the heartbreaking collision of an innocent idealistic girl with a cruel, self-serving society. As with his 1996 film ‘Breaking the Waves’, ‘Dancer in the Dark’ displays von Trier’s attempts to project himself onto female characters and thus examine the repressed ‘feminine’ attributes of his personality, such as religious belief, emotion, and self sacrifice. When questioned about the suffering of the female characters in his films, von Trier has simply stated ‘those characters are not women. They are self-portraits.’ There is no doubt that ‘Dancer in the Dark’ is a divisive film, but I found it to be an utterly enthralling and devastating play on a genre I usually despise.

It must be stated here that I am a longtime admirer of Lars von Trier as a director. I have, for the most part, held back from writing about his films for fear of not doing them the justice they deserve, or perhaps for fear of writing a biassed and dogmatic piece. I was moved to action after my fourth viewing of ‘Dancer in the Dark’ at a local film festival, where I once again finished the film in tears. Björk’s astoundingly honest portrayal of Selma, coupled with von Trier’s twisted take on the classic Hollywood musical, creates a viewing experience that is at once magical and nightmarish.

Musical segments in ‘Dancer in the Dark’ are coupled with a vibrant attack of colour and a shift from the subjective handheld camera; thus, as the film progresses, the viewer is made increasingly aware of the contrast between the depressing reality of Selma’s life and the idealism of her musical daydreams. Though the musical segments of ‘Dancer in the Dark’ provide the viewer with brief respite from the film’s gruelling portrayal of Selma’s suffering, each return to the film’s narrative becomes more and more difficult to bear. In fact, it is hard to imagine ‘Dancer in the Dark’ delivering the perfection it does without the presence of Björk. The innocence she exudes as Selma and her characteristically strange yet hauntingly beautiful musical performances provide a much-needed counterbalance to von Trier’s unyielding directorial style. As Selma, Björk embodies exquisitely the martyr-like, humanistic qualities of the heroines of the Golden Heart Trilogy.

‘Dancer in the Dark’ is tragically beautiful, and possesses the rare ability to quite literally take your breath away whilst you are watching it. You do not have to support von Trier, the controversial figure that he is, to appreciate the masterfully experimental and dazzlingly provocative nature of his filmmaking. Björk is always astounding, and the emotional intensity of her performance as Selma is at once spellbinding and agonising. Von Trier’s Golden Heart trilogy is, in my opinion, the best showcase of his work.

barbie	TrueFilm	15zio68	1692829038	on Ken Masculinity in Barbie (2023)	"first post, first time publicly posting media analysis. took a course on this before and i've done some school essays, but whatever. i know this movie's a dead horse now, but i felt that it resonated with me to a level that i just needed to get out. hope this place can appreciate my takes. 

##### Ken and the crisis of masculinity as possession.

“you  have to figure out who you are without me. you’re not your girlfriend,  you’re not your house, you’re not your mink … you’re not even beach.”

Ken  masculinity is a very cleverly midpoint between patriarchal masculinity  and inverted patriarchal femininity. on one hand, Kens show demure  behaviour, being clumsy and shy. they are second class citizens in  Barbieland, and need to depend on Barbies to find meaning. the movie  makes it very clear at the start that Ken’s existence and value is  defined by the way Barbie looks at him. they’re also very clearly  oppressed, as they can’t choose the way they want to do their hair or  dress.

at the same time, they follow the rules of a classical  patriarchal masculinity as well. the first beach scene is typical  masculine peacocking behaviour (look how fit i am and how well i can  perform. i hope this grants me your attention). they’re chasing after  love in a way similar to patriarchal masculinity. “go out there, reach  out to her. make the first move.” and they suffer emotionally from a  similar rejection / friendzoning phenomenon. however, this position is  not threatening for the Barbies. they also suffer from a sense of lack  of attention (you can see this in the “Hey Barbie! hey ken.” scene, but  also later when Ken makes a huge deal out of a woman asking him about  the time). they are objectified, but rather than struggling against a  romantically smothering oppressor class, they suffer against one that’s  cold and distant to their advances.

so, what does Ken do in  response to the Real World patriarchy that he sees? he’s enamoured by  wealth, fitness, cars, horses, liberation from women, presidency,  historical relevance, beer, and more repetitions of the same. this is  not very different from what a young boy might imagine. of course having  relevant figures of social prominence helps you to ground your gendered  identity into a meaningful position (a privilege that historically  women have not had, and one that’s difficult to perceive when you have  it). the rest are symbols of machismo and brotherhood. these are what  Ken wants to take back to Barbieland. quite frankly a lot of his  “patriarchy” business doesn’t really involve subjugating women, but they  do get in his way. we can read Kendom as a sort of a slave revolt.

but  Ken doesn’t just bring back aesthetic symbols of patriarchy. he also  brings back the obligation to power. there’s the derisive phrases that  he calls Barbie like “mini-baby”, but we shouldn’t be reading this as a  Machiavellian desire for power. later we see him try to make her his  “low commitment long distance girlfriend”, pretends to be reading books  to impress her, flexes his muscles, etc. we can very clearly see that  these aren’t his true feelings. what he has included here is *distance*.  patriarchy teaches men that distance is attractive, and being overly  affectionate (often equivalent with expressing one’s romantic feelings)  is effeminate. at the same time, they have to get out there and present  themselves, balancing availability with manufactured distance.

and  the culmination of all of these sentiments comes in the Just Ken song.  the word that i like to use to describe this collection of issues is *hyper-subjectivity*,  unrequited life. the individual is nothing but their actions and  choices. while possessing perfect agency, the world becomes immediately a  quiet and lonely place. there is no one to respond back. feelings are  invalid, because feelings possess you, not the other way round. value  comes in possession, both of material and people. the world can be bent  to the individual’s will, and while it is an extension of their will it  is *just that*. the outside world itself becomes a lie because  all that’s worth observing is that which one can possess and exert power  over. and if you do not exert power, you’re left in silence because  possessors are aplenty and that which cannot be your property will  eventually be someone else’s. the compulsion to possess makes life a  competition, where one must have more or less than the other. the  possessors cannot ever be victims, because in the moment they accept  victimhood they have admitted that they do not have agency. that they  were weak. and the weak will never be able to possess. one’s value as a  possessor is not defined by any personal traits, because the identity of  a possessor strips a person of their personality. while the world is an  extension of the will, the ego becomes equivalent to the person’s  material presence. your value is what you own, you must present what you  own. everything you are is measurable, and the measure of your  possession is the measure of your value. true intimacy is not possible,  because one is forever busy in the pursuit of possessing. hobbies and  clubs are a waste of time. love is expressed in the number of people you  have once possessed. the number suddenly becomes more relevant than the  quality of love, and sexuality is perceived not as bonding and mutual  intimacy but as a conquest of the other. the greatest conquerers are  then looked up to, and their principles are taken for granted as truth.  for to be a successful man, one must be a successful conquerer. this is  what i have, after much speculation, deciphered as the mental plague  that affects men (of course, to varying degrees of pathology). one can  argue it’s a symptom of capitalism moreso than patriarchy. i think the  two structures work hand in hand. possession is the only way for the  patriarch to legitimise his power.

so, how does this tie into the  song lyrics? Just Ken is not the war cry of the dominant “alpha”  oppressive possessing powerful male. it’s the cry of the man who *cannot*  be that. of that who has the will to possess forced upon him and is yet  lacking the power to possess. he cannot be a valuable person because he  does not possess, and at the same time the will to possess forces him  to hide his feelings towards Barbie. because he’s not allowed to share  love with her, only to do love onto her. he rues that he cannot be the  “alpha” (“i’m always number two”), that the world’s rules are rigged  against him (“anywhere else i’d be a ten”), that he’s been nice his  whole life (which he has), but patriarchy has given him the compulsion  to fight alone and distance himself from his love. he experiences a  distance from reality, a self-doubt that he’s not able to stand up to  his macho ideals. the whole purpose behind this is the pursuit of value  and meaning. but this meaning is eventually found.

the end of Just  Ken is very meaningful. he thought that to be given value he would have  to possess the property, material, and women around him (“when i was  walking on the streets, the people valued me just for who i am”). he  perceived patriarchy as giving him inherent value, but he was wrong. the  value given to him was a power that he had to uphold, and one that he  didn’t like upholding. at the end of the song, this sentiment is fixed.  “i’m Just Ken, and that’s enough.” value no longer needs to be in  possessing, it can be achieved only by being oneself. the immeasurable unquantifiable personality is returned to its deserving seat of value.  he’s “great at doing stuff” and doesn’t need to give an explanation  beyond that. by quashing competitive possession he has laid the way to a  new, more sincere brotherhood. the next scene puts this renewed value  system to the test.

Ken has now lost the possessions that gave him  patriarchal power. what does he do? he’s frustrated, he runs into bed  and cries. he’s not a power-hungry lunatic, he acknowledges that it was  something he felt forced upon him. what he wanted was love,  togetherness, mutual intimacy with Barbie. maintaining the appearances  of patriarchy was a headache, but he felt compelled to do it. she had  cut him off, even more distant than one would keep a friend. she  apologises, rightly so. but what does he do?

he jumps to kiss her.  it’s Ken’s last bastion of externally acquired meaning, one that  existed even outside the realm of power. to love and to be loved. the  knight must rescue the princess to be a valuable night. the prince must  find Cinderella, or kiss the Sleeping Beauty, or any of the other things  that a good man does. love is a prerequisite to any successful man. one  must look only to their parents to see this. but he can’t have that  love. “i only exist within the warmth of your gaze.” this is both  showing him in the form of a stereotypical heroine who must only abide  by the desires of the male gaze, and the male lover who must go to the  ends of the earth to woo his beloved.

Barbie tells him he needs to  rediscover his meaning, and Ken again elopes with her. when he’s told  he’s wrong, he slaps himself down. there is no further needed proof that  love is far more of a compulsion for him than a choice. it’s something  he has to back off from but doesn’t know how. and he internalises guilt  about it. i’ve seen quite a few men who stay utterly silent about their  romantic feelings because of the guilt that it makes them feel, although  of course it isn’t a distinctly manly problem. the next sequence is a  reinforcement of what i just described. Ken is told that he should  perceive his value internally, not in his possessions or conquests. this  is Ken’s resolution, and he accepts it with open arms.

i hope we  all recognise that Ken is not made as a punching bag of a character.  while he is melodramatic like most other things in the movie, both his  suffering and foolishness are largely humanised. he’s given due  apologies, chances to express his resentment, and a solid redemption.  just because he’s made as an unintelligent character doesn’t mean he’s  not human. he’s not there to just be the butt of jokes. i think we can  almost all recall some fictional character who’s lovable precisely  because of their unintelligence. it’s a raw, naive, childish, yet  entirely human medium of expression. anyone criticising his presentation  as “anti-male” either doesn’t understand men, is utterly lacking in  empathy, or entirely media illiterate."	/r/TrueFilm/comments/15zio68/on_ken_masculinity_in_barbie_2023/	https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/15zio68/on_ken_masculinity_in_barbie_2023/

Hey guys! I love doing projects like this just for fun. I love rating and ranking movies and doing brackets. It's a real sweet spot for me. I had this idea the other day so I figured I should pursue it. How this came to be was that I took a look at the most popular movies on Letterboxd, then I split them up into the 8 genres you see above. The seeds were simply determined by how high they were on Letterboxd's popularity list. There was a little bit of fudging with the genres just to make everything fit, but I don't believe there is anything egregiously out of place. For those who want to see all of the seeds broken down, here they are...

mi7	movies	1kxlq2y	1748450131	How would you rank the Mission Impossible movies?	"Now that the franchise has concluded (for now anyway), how would you rank all the Mission Impossible movies? Here's how I would, from best to worst:

1. Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol
2. Mission Impossible: Fallout
3. Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning Part 1
4. Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation
5. Mission Impossible: The Final Reckoning
6. Mission Impossible
7. Mission Impossible III
8. Mission Impossible II

To quickly note, Ghost Protocol and Fallout are basically tied for me. In fact the ones I ranked 1-4 are damn close to each other in quality. Definitely one of the more consistent franchises ever."	/r/movies/comments/1kxlq2y/how_would_you_rank_the_mission_impossible_movies/	https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1kxlq2y/how_would_you_rank_the_mission_impossible_movies/	
barbie	movies	1iyrjpe	1740587365	Best movie with trans characters/actors?	"As a trans woman I love me some trans representation. What do y'all think is the best movie with trans characters or actors? I've seen Boy Meets Girl, Tangerine and Barbie. Out of these I'd say Barbie is probably the best, but the trans character is barely even in the movie tbf.

Do y'all think I Saw the TV Glow counts? Cuz if so then it's definitely my pick as the best lol"	/r/movies/comments/1iyrjpe/best_movie_with_trans_charactersactors/	https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1iyrjpe/best_movie_with_trans_charactersactors/	
oppenheimer	TrueFilm	15lxuat	1691536645	On Oppenheimer and Nolan (Spoilers)	"I tried to watch the film outside the “meta” surrounding this release, i stepped into a regular theater (no Imaxes where I live) and really tried to watch it for what it is. The below are some of my observations and personal opinions, i do not want to offend anyone and totally respect people that loved the film.In my view, Oppenheimer presented 2 problems that needed solving by Nolan in order to fit his style.

1. How do you take a movie that is mostly people talking and make it engaging and pacey
2. How do we play around the timeline because it's a Nolan film, and we need non-linear storytelling.

The solutions he gave to these 2 “problems”, in my humble opinion, are what sank this movie.

Concerning problem no.1, if this was Spielberg for example, scenes would be blocked meticulously, the coverage would be inventive and the camera would dance around its subjects to keep things interesting in a meaningful manner. Nolan’s solution to this problem was different:He opted for a breakneck pace that resembles an extended trailer, with elliptical edits between scenes, the movie felt like a barrage of hasty scene highlights with a few “full scenes” sprinkled left and right. The film felt that it never settled down, an endless montage sequence.

Underneath those scenes is a pulsating score that elevates tension constantly, and to cap it all off, he resorted to “jump scares”. 2-3 sec cut-aways of atoms orbiting, or detonators going off that were accompanied by VERY LOUD sound effects, I honestly could picture him in the editing room saying “we need to wake them up”.

All this columnated into the bomb going off, after which the film completely changes tone, and devolves into the world’s most boring court drama. Sitting down in a tiny room, for 20-25 minutes combined, with the same 3-4 angles, it was the most boring 30 minutes i’ve witnessed at the movies in recent memory. I know history had to be covered there, but Nolan’s mundane coverage and choices of what to keep and what to throw out, and where to place things, especially for that last stretch, ruined the film completely for me.

For problem No.2, i understand that Nolan said that B&amp;W moments were “factual, cold facts, objective, not subjective”, Strausse needed to be included in this story, the scenes have historical significance, but the whole A-B timeline with RDJ was placed earlier so we can have the “twist” at the end. There was little to no value to the main story line everytime we cut back to RDJ, apart from the “council” scenes over the table. For some reason he feels compelled to mix timelines, it's his “shtick”.

If you go to any film school and see the stories young film students want to do, you will find that most of them are dealing with these kind of gimmicks, time travel, alternative points of view, non-linear storytelling, it feels smart and impressive when pulled off. it's the realization of a young person that editing is, really, in cinematic terms, the manipulation of time and space. It's nothing new.

Before Nolan, and after him, this is something you see over and over again usually in film schools, until said individuals grow out of it and realize structure alone is not enough. I fell out of love with Nolan when I realized that he’s really the ultimate film student, he never grew out of it, and like M. Night Shyamalan, he writes himself into a corner with every outing, compelled to play with structure because it's his “thing”.

Nolan talks a lot on how he “writes” films, with diagrams, and shapes, and timelines, maybe that’s why to me, his films always feel “engineered”, bereft of emotion, with their players locked inside that maze he wrote, reciting (mostly) bad dialogue (although i have to admit, Oppenheimer had less Nolan-cringe dialogue than his usual fare).

On a technical note, the IMAX element is wasted here, its purely marketing at this point, what you would get on an IMAX screen vs regular theater, apart from the few wide shots, is more forehead and neck, the movie is mostly close-ups. Also, that 70mm gate is so huge, that the focal point is so narrow, MANY of those close-ups were soft, out of focus."	/r/TrueFilm/comments/15lxuat/on_oppenheimer_and_nolan_spoilers/	https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/15lxuat/on_oppenheimer_and_nolan_spoilers/

Hey guys! I love doing projects like this just for fun. I love rating and ranking movies and doing brackets. It's a real sweet spot for me. I had this idea the other day so I figured I should pursue it. How this came to be was that I took a look at the most popular movies on Letterboxd, then I split them up into the 8 genres you see above. The seeds were simply determined by how high they were on Letterboxd's popularity list. There was a little bit of fudging with the genres just to make everything fit, but I don't believe there is anything egregiously out of place. For those who want to see all of the seeds broken down, here they are...

oppenheimer	movies	1bc1xz0	1710159923	Fillean an Feall short film	"The semi-famous actor Cillian Murphy of Oppenheimer and Peaky Blinders fame was in a short Irish Language film.  It was made in 2000.  As the title states it’s a short film, only about 20 minutes.  It’s set in a Gaeltacht which are exclusively Irish speaking areas in Ireland, they are few and far between.

barbie	TrueFilm	1aikyl8	1707042436	Poor Things: A near-perfect film that felt like discovering life anew.	"Simply blown away by this movie, may well be my favorite of 2023. Would've been more or less flawless if the third act wasn't as bloated and languidly paced, but it wasn't enough to ruin the film. I'm so glad I went in more or less blind to this movie - I knew the basic premise, but the details were all the most pleasant of surprises.

Emma Stone deserves all the awards for this performance. Even within the opening minutes this clearly felt like a role that any actor would leap at the chance to play, but I can't imagine anyone else doing it now. Watching her evolve from a child pieced together with spare parts to a mature woman was enthralling, and both she and the movie immediately made you fall in love with her weirdness. Some part of me was slightly dismayed to see her become more ""normal"" (especially as she began to see the ugliness of the world), since her sweet naivete seemed to function as a mirror to deconstruct much of the pointless misery and cynicism we as a species trade in. Watching her felt like discovering life anew. I wish I could be a fly on the wall during her sessions crafting this character alongside Lanthimos and Tony McNamara. It was both spontaneous and specific to a degree only the most skillful of artists could conceive of.

Nearly everyone else brought their A-game too. Dafoe was predictably marvelous, and his character had a lot more warmth and kindness than I expected. Watching him casually rationalize his father's deranged cruelty in the name of science provided some of the film's most quietly devastating moments. Ruffalo was an absolute revelation, taking a character that could've become a grating caricature and making him a hilariously watchable presence. It was the mix of primal rage and self-debasing comedy that his last few Hulk appearances have not properly afforded him. I loved Christopher Abbott in his brief scenes even though I feel his character's inclusion in the story was extraneous - he was equal parts charming and horrifying. Carmichael was the one miscast. Felt totally out of place, and his line readings were devoid of any personality.

The art direction and visual style came as a complete surprise to me. I figured the black and white portions would take some aesthetic liberties, but that first shot of Lisbon with all the paper-cutout backgrounds and steampunk elements seriously took me aback, and I realized the world of this movie was 10x as imaginative as it already was. More or less every shot in this movie was a visual feast, making painterly use of vibrant colors to create gorgeous, surreal, magnificently weird worlds. Many of the establishing shots reminded me of the work of [Erik Johansson](https://www.erikjo.com/work/loyalmail). The movie's visual inventiveness extended beyond just the cinematography and set design but also the font choices, the way the credits were arranged onscreen (wrapping around the borders of the frame), and of course those incredible title cards which I couldn't get enough of. Worlds within worlds.

I didn't want the movie to end during the first 2/3rds. I expected the movie to be at least somewhat funny, but it was fucking HILARIOUS, with me and my whole row in the theater laughing out loud at so many points. The humor in the movie worked mainly because it came from physical gags and inherently funny situations rather than just canned one-liners like you see in most Hollywood comedies. Dafoe burping those fucking bubbles for one, lost it every time. Most of the funniest moments were between Stone and Ruffalo (an incredible comic duo), especially the scene where she spits out her food during a dinner with another couple and the women joke about their partners' penises. It sounds so basic on paper and yet the script and actors made it uniquely brilliant. So much humor in Bella's many ingenious, adorable phrases for things. ""Furious jumping"" needs to become a meme.

The movie did sag a fair bit once it hit the brothel section in Paris, though this felt intentional. Much of the movie was an allegory for the disappointments of adulthood, and we could see both Bella's eccentricities and the movie's visual flair tone down as she matured. Though there was something very inspiring (perhaps even zen) about seeing Bella treat her own misfortune and depression about the world as yet another thing to be experienced and explored rather than avoided. Her foray into philosophy could've easily become hamfisted and sermonlike, but it felt authentic and genuine in the hands of McNamara and Stone. Still, the movie spent so long in that brothel that it became visually monotonous after the varied cadence established during the first half. 

The whole sequence with the first husband could've been cut out entirely - again, Abbott was magnificent and completely took command of the screen in the final stretch, but those scenes hammered home points that had already been thoroughly made by then, and fucked with the pace of the movie a lot. I understand Bella's curiosity about her ""past"" life, but her decision to simply ditch Max and Godwin to go with this guy felt reckless and out of character, and in either case I don't think the movie needed to ""explain"" Victoria's suicide. The film already examined its themes of men's possessiveness over women in far more elegant fashion during the first half, and didn't need an abusive maniac husband character to drive that point home any further. Still though, the bit with the goat was a fantastic way to end the movie.

Hope this wins a bunch of major awards. I think it has Barbie beat not just thematically but even in the art direction/production design/cinematography department, and Stone handily deserves Best Actress. I loved her in The Favourite and La La Land, but this is far and away her best performance. It's always wonderful seeing a partnership between a director and an actor blossom like this, and the Lanthimos-Stone collaboration has the potential to go down in history as one of cinema's great creative pairings. They really bring out the best in each other, and this movie channeled their talents into one of the most vividly alive pieces of filmmaking I've watched."	/r/TrueFilm/comments/1aikyl8/poor_things_a_nearperfect_film_that_felt_like/	https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/1aikyl8/poor_things_a_nearperfect_film_that_felt_like/	
barbie	movies	16uu2wq	1695940652	What is your favorite depressing/sad quote from a movie that isn’t sad?	"(SPOILERS FOR “Barbie” AHEAD!)

I think one of my favorite quotes is from “Barbie” and it is a perfect example of this. While the movie has plenty of sad moments, it is a comedy film at the end of the day. But one of my favorite lines comes near the end of the film when Ruth is walking with Barbie. After Ruth tells Barbie that she had always hoped for Barbie as she did for her own daughter, she says:

“We mothers stand still so our daughters can look back and see how far they’ve come.”

The true meaning of this line has been debated and everyone has their own meaning for it. But when I first heard it, it made me think long and hard on the sacrifices that my own mother has made for me throughout my life. To me, the line isn’t made to be a representation of anything but political or feminism-related, but rather focuses solely on motherhood.

I think its talking about how mothers tend to give up things like politics or careers in order to become a mother. In devoting their time to becoming a mother, they give their daughter the ability to do what they might’ve been able to do, had they not given up everything to have children.

As I said before, it’s a pretty powerful quote that made me think long and hard about how my mom gave up a lot of her time to help me become successful. Here I am 18 years later with multiple scholarships up my sleeve and a dream to become a veterinarian.

Anyways, what is a perfect example of this for you?"	/r/movies/comments/16uu2wq/what_is_your_favorite_depressingsad_quote_from_a/	https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/16uu2wq/what_is_your_favorite_depressingsad_quote_from_a/

oppenheimer	movies	1bkf7ba	1711049594	I did not care for Oppenheimer, but I absolutely loved Napoleon	"I did not care for Oppenheimer. I like most of Nolan's movies but I have two big issues with them. 

The Editing

The Score

I really don't like Nolan's editing. He jumps around way too much, scenes can be quite short, and it always feels like he is trying to cram a 6 hour movie into 2.5 hours. Interstellar doesn't have this issue, but all his other movies do in my opinion. 

And the score exaserbates this problem because in a lot of his movies he does not match a scene change with a change in score; its the same score for then entire movie usually and it gives it this feel that movie is droning on. Like, when does the movie go from act 1 to 2 exactly? I understand the story can let us know, but sound can too.

I also did not like the non-chronoligcal nature of Oppenheimer. And as much as I like Cillian Murphy, I did not like his acting in this movie. 

Napoleon on the other hand was an absolute masterpiece. Amazing set and costume desing, the costumes! and there was so much practical effects in the movie. Such amazing action. 

The Dialogue was superb, I loved how weird it was. People are complaining it painted Napoleon in a negative and unhistorical way but I don't care because his character was just outstanding. It did such a good job of showing him being a talented but unruly man-child. 

10/10 for me."	/r/movies/comments/1bkf7ba/i_did_not_care_for_oppenheimer_but_i_absolutely/	https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1bkf7ba/i_did_not_care_for_oppenheimer_but_i_absolutely/	
barbie	movies	1em2up3	1723005110	Popeye (1980) was a great yet unfairly maligned movie. But I'd change a few things.	"Greta Gerwig's Barbie might have gotten a lot of credit for being from an auteur known for serious work, who went on to make a live action cartoon to great success. But Robert Altman did it first with Popeye. Its laidback tone, its atmosphere, its slice of life storytelling, it really didn't get the props it deserved and I'm thankful it's considered a classic now. 

But I'd change two things: the casting of Popeye and Olive Oyl. Everyone else is great but the leads are miscast. Robin Williams and Shelly Duvall were wonderful actors and may they rest in peace but it felt they were cast due to popularity (in Williams' case) or being already part of the director's troupe (in Duvall's case) 

If you were to invent a Time Machine, grab (90s) Jim Carrey for Popeye and (current time) Rachel Brosnahan as Olive Oyl, put them in 1980, it'd be perfect. Those two were born for these roles. Would it have made the film a success? ...Probably not. But it'd improve upon near-perfection at the very least.

So until that day comes, and this post won't make any sense, any thoughts on the movie?"	/r/movies/comments/1em2up3/popeye_1980_was_a_great_yet_unfairly_maligned/	https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1em2up3/popeye_1980_was_a_great_yet_unfairly_maligned/	
indiana_jones	movies	1c8o7dm	1713614202	What's a movie / saga, that inspired the biggest generations of kids into a job?	"I work in Academia.  I don't have the numbers.  But maybe:

\- Jurassic Park inspired the greatest amount of kids into Paleontology, or-

\- Indiana Jones inspired the greatest amount of kids into Archeology, or-

\- Iron Man inspired the greatest amount of kids into Engineering, or-

\- Harry Potter Did Not inspire kids to want to move into magic, but conversely, inspired the greatest amount of kids into Writing.

I truly doubt a large amount of people grew up wanting to work in state security because of James Bond.  However, I do believe a lot of women grew up watching Clarice Starling (from ""The Silence of the Lambs"") wanting to work in police investigation, but not to a large extent.  Furthermore, ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" could've inspired a generation of lawyers.

In regards to Television, ""The Andy Griffith Show"" could've inspired a lot of Baby Boomers to move into Police work.  Also ""Top Gear"" could've inspired a lot of people to move into car engineering.  And ""Grand Designs"" could've inspired a generation of Architects.

Granted, it's weird to think I'm pretty much the same age now as he was back then yet if I stood side by side with a 38 year old Harrison Ford...I'd look like a little kid next to him.

"It's amazing that a film that had such a dominating presence in mainstream consciousness became pretty irrelevant just a few months later.

indiana_jones	movies	1hssbxd	1735926614	Looking Back On 2024 (A Cinematic Year in Review)	"As a preface, I will only list here what I watched during the past year, which includes the delayees (is that even a word) from 2023, movies moved to 2024 due to the idiotic distribution structure of my country. These include The Iron Claw, The Holdovers, Poor Things, May December, The Zone of Interest, The Boy and the Heron, Priscilla and the Anatomy of a Fall. Some others I didn’t get around to watch or haven’t heard of before 2024, like Sisu, Kiss The Girls or Mr. Holmes. With that out of the way, let’s get down to it!

34. Rebel Moon: A Child of Fire. No surprise here, but I still think it’s a half-decent movie. I mean, of course, most of the plot is claptrap (despite a couple good in-isolation scenes), the lore is established way too haphazardly for its own good and the cinematography doesn’t provide as much gravitas or atmosphere to the scenes as it thinks it is, but Snyder still manages to squeeze out some nice performances (in particular from Michiel Huisman and the delightfully malicious Ed Skrein as Admiral Atticus Noble). And the score by Junkie XL unironically SLAPS. It’s weighty, ethereal and immersive as fuck, especially everytime chorals and angry artificial howling - Noble’s theme - can be heard on the screen. It is ultimately due to the music that the movie is not a failure.

33. Godzilla X Kong: A New Empire. This one’s merit, on the other hand, lies exclusively in the visual spectacle. Here Holkenborg could not cook up something noteworthy, but the action carried hard. I mean, mostly because the Skar King and Shimo’s battle against G and K wore off pretty quickly. The human characters were uncompelling, the story presented no interesting themes, and the visuals I found pretty below average. It was just mediocre.

32. Rebel Moon: The Scargiver. A slight bump as far as overall cinematic quality is concerned. The cinematography offers something more visually enthralling, and this time Snyder’s time wasting pays off in a way. Holkenborg keeps the score quality intact, as is the case with Skrein’s performance. But the movie is still a haphazardly conceived mess of poorly constructed, bizarrely acting individuals I’ve little to no connection to. So, a miss.

31. Ferrari. I don’t have a whole lot to say about it, other than the faux-Italian accents were a definite miss, and everything aside from the racing scenes and Penelope Cruz’s performance was just uninteresting. But Cruz and the races carried hard, plain and simple. Still, a mediocre movie that fails to examine its protagonist.

30. Mr. Holmes. It was an overall interesting take on an older Holmes, with Ian McKellen turning in a memorable performance as both versions of the character. To me the film did a good job juggling three separate plotlines, all of which had some merit. All in all, a graceful portrayal of an aged hero that lost most things and people he cared about. For some it’ll certainly be more graceful than the fates of Indiana Jones, Han Solo and Luke Skywalker.

29. The Boy and the Heron. Compared to how praised it was… I was disappointed. Maybe it was just me getting to know Miyazaki for the first time for real. But interestingly enough, I found very little interesting content in the movie other than the animation itself and the Grey Heron. I sure felt for Mahito, but I didn’t get to know him a whole lot in a substantial way. Nor any other character, really. They were like silhouettes, just passing through the screen, mere figures pushing Mahito to the next plot point. And his grand-grand-grand uncle? A complete afterthought. I don’t even know why he created that fantastical world, and a minute of WW2 carnage coupled with a few throwaway lines about the world’s “wickedness” a theme make not, sadly. But it’s still a good movie.

28. The Beekeeper. I had a good time, despite a plot light on thematics and character, but loaded with an absurd amount of bee metaphors. Adam, Jason Statham’s character, was reasonably grounded with both ruthlessness for capitalist scammers and care for ordinary citizens. Add some nice visuals, twists and supporting performances and you got a good, if overall run-of-the-mill action flick.

27. Scent of a Woman. Yeah, I like it. Most of it boils down to a fucking tour de force performance by Al Pacino and character work related to his character, but he just makes it work, especially with the “I’ll show you OUT OF ORDER!” scene. I won’t elaborate any further.

26. Insurrectionist 1863. For the first time we venture into Poland to see a historical movie telling the story of Father Stanisław Brzóska’s involvement in the January Uprising of 1863. The priest himself aside, the characters weren’t too compelling, but Brzóska’s journey throughout the movie, especially his role as a priest evolving in the conflict, makes it all worth it. This is a piece of cinema hard carried by the protagonist.

25. Screw Mickiewicz. Once more a Polish film which will (most likely) only hit for you if you’re from the country like myself. But it was a genuinely hilarious and lively flick, with a lot of actual understanding of the teenage Poles’ mentality and some fairly emotional moments. Also, a really nice soundtrack assembled from the works of modern Polish rap and pop artists.

24. The Iron Claw. Another overrated - if nearly actually great - darling of 2023. Like with Miyazaki’s piece, I felt little emotional connection to the Von Erich brothers, the most belonging to David - who died first. The amount of bad shit happening in succession was also too much; it felt like, dare I say, misery porn at times. No interesting cinematography (save for the black ‘n’ white opening) or music either. But the movie did present a compelling story looking at the plot elements themselves, and Fritz Von Erich was a very well-realized character.

23. May December. The first proper great movie of the bunch. Maybe some more time should have been spent on dissecting the relationship between Melton’s Joe and Moore’s Gracie, but since the protagonist is a sensationalist, self-important bitch that doesn’t care about the people she’ll be portraying, that’s what we get. Speaking of which, Natalie Portman made the movie for me, it was like a female Kirk Lazarus performance, absolutely stunning. Technical side of things wise it didn’t wow me, but its examination of the subject matter is absolutely commendable.

22. Sisu. Holy crap, what a great action flick. A bunch of decently despicable Nazis against an endlessly adaptable Finnish vet/hermit. Some nice team work between him and the enslaved women in the end, enthralling action and the pure grit make for a great offering. Again, see it in case you have not!

21. Alien: Romulus. I never hated Covenant (I just thought the ending with le bad guy David winning was stupid, which was understandable given the fact I was 14 back then and didn’t truly recognize the merit of bleaker closures in cinema), so I didn’t expect Romulus to be a “return to form”, but its upholding, which it was. Cailee Spaeny once again smashed the hell out of her role, nailing her more relaxed and tense scenes a like. She is also able to just… appear and act genuinely likeable, she makes for a rootable protagonist, y’know? Another standout is David Jonsson, playing an android like he was Paul Bettany or goddamn Michael Fassbender himself. Ian Holm’s undead appearance is irksome, sure, but they managed to disguise it well enough for me not to detect it until after I delved into the discourse. The horror of the aliens? On point. Atmosphere? Impeccable. Visuals? Breathtaking.

20. Rebel Ridge. This one is a milder offering spectacle and politics wise compared to the ones that come after it in the list, but it’s a worthy watch. The opener alone is a powerful one, and while perhaps not entirely accurate to how these things would go down, it gave me a good idea of the possible ways American cops abuse their authority, especially in regards to black people. And it’s consistently great throughout, especially with its execution of the non-killing protagonist.

19. Kiss The Girls. It’s an older one, but it checks out. I especially appreciate the sheer terror of the Casanova, both pre and post-reveal. Morgan Freeman, Cary Elwes and Ashley Judd all crushed their roles. But this won’t do the movie any justice… If you haven’t seen it for yourself, do it.

18. Furiosa. As far as prequels go, this one’s neat. Important info regarding the Mad Max world is there, coupled with brilliant performances by Anya Taylor-Joy (how the hell did she manage to emulate Charlize this well?! HOW?!) and Chris Hemsworth, who, channeling his inner Thor, puts a MadMaxesque spin on it, adding a layer of post-apocalyptic internal hollowness and insatiable, self-fueling cruelty and hatred, bred by some terrible trauma, not unlike Furiosa’s (or Thor’s, for that matter). I suppose that’s the main merit of the movie, the ways in which they mirror each other. Which makes their final scene together a fucking standout. Also, pay attention to the History Man: George Shevtsov is fantastic in the role, and occasionally he drops Thanos-level banger lines, adding both philosophical ideas and vulnerability to the story.

17. Joker: Folie à Deux. Likely the most controversial take, but I love this movie. It takes the well-known story from 2019, puts it in a new setting and makes the most of it. I was especially stoked once I realized the musical inserts were fantasies, extensions of Arthur and Harley’s desires, fears and wishes. The score provided a nice layer of gloominess to the whole, the cinematography was jaw-dropping, and I can’t help but find the conclusion… fitting. Like many others have said before me: it wasn’t about the Clown Prince of Crime. It was about a marginalized man who inadvertently became a symbol and an outlet for disillusioned citizens to embody their own fear and anger, only to be hated, rejected and forgotten once he declared he shared their fear and anger no longer. A beautiful deconstruction.

16. Scarborn. Another Polish film, but this time it’s a historical action flick. Centered around the Kościuszko Insurrection of 1794 it provides a pretty immersive piece of historical fiction centered around how said Insurrection came to be. Wait through the lengthy build up and the final act will wow you with Tarantino-esque tension and spectacle. Some fantastic cinematography, too!

15. Anora. This hurts me the most, because I believe it’s an impressive offering, but lacks “the sauce”. As great as Mikey Madison was as Anora, as believable as the world and characters around her were, I found insufficient amounts of context to care about her as much as Baker wanted me to. How fucking sad it is that I found TOROS, the main henchman character more interesting and entertaining to watch than her? Didn’t help that Baker couldn’t find the right tone for several scenes, especially the supposedly serious ones overloaded with comedic inserts… But his direction, especially the camera movement was without a doubt a true show of skill, and I cannot find any fault in the cinematography and non-lead performances either.

14. Wrooklyn Zoo. Yet another Polish movie in the mix, and most likely the most special one. It’s about Poland’s modern problems, the virtues and sins of the old and the youth and the absolutely amazing yet painful feeling that is love. While I don’t think our protagonists were amazing characters and the final act relies on a bit of resurrectionist Hollywood bullshit, the movie drips with style, heart and distinct energy that’s hard to put into words. Also, the pacing was fantastic. Made it seem like a movie of twice its length yet endlessly captivating.

13. Civil War. My introduction to Alex Garland, and what an introduction that was! My most favorite thing about it is just how hard it drills into the conflict between journalistic integrity and the pervasive sensationalist nature of the job, especially in America. Every single main character felt like a real person with their own ideas and priorities, everyone embodied their characters to a fault, and I could only watch with wonder and horror as their lives and jobs turned to shit due to the eponymous conflict. The final third is as captivating as it is devastating and can really make you think about the possibility of objective, well-intentioned documentation of tragedies.

12. The Holdovers. Maybe the most wholesome and hilarious thing I saw in 2024. Along the incredible, sharp performances by Paul Giamatti, Dominic Sessa and Da’Vine Joy Randolph wraps Alexander Payne’s whimsical yet touching screenplay. It’s a movie that understands the bitter, but at the same time shows them their current state of being doesn’t have to be what defines their life or gives it purpose.

11. Carry-On. I expected it to be a somewhat interesting execution of a promising premise. But man oh MAN, I was not prepared to witness the absolute CINEMA of it all, not at all! Everyone from Edgerton to Bateman is on their A game, the protagonist and the antagonists constantly outsmarting each other makes for an endlessly tense and riveting dynamic, and even the themes themselves present some interesting commentary about military subcontractors, arms deals and the boogeyman of Russian threat to America.

10. Poor Things. The VERY dodgy implications of what is being done to Bella and the unnecessary POV shift from the source material aside, this was a sublime introduction to Lanthimos. Whatever the scene called for, the man and his crew were more than up for the task. Tension, wonder, elation, terror, despair, hopelessness, cynicism, fulfillment, whimsy… all conveyed with a weirdness I suppose is uniquely his. Also, BRAVO to Jerskin Fendrix for that score. Bizarre yet utterly enthralling in how intrusive and odd it is. And to Emma Stone, who can like no other portray a determined, stoically wisecracking British woman.

9. The A(A)-Team. The final Polish offering. I did not expect to love it as much as I did. But when you get a bunch of terribly scarred yet well-meaning people trying to atone for what they did as alcoholics, a plot that combines the whackier sides of Poland and a very emotional main goal, with vibes and directorial style that keeps you glued to the screen no matter what, you get pretty good fucking cinema. My personal standouts are the little monochrome pencil-driven flashback animations that, combined with the protagonists’ voiceover, explain the mistakes they made and the pain they caused.

8. Priscilla. Cailee Spaeny should’ve been nominated for this, no doubt. She is as believable as her character at 14 as she is at 25. Her ability to transition between ages was just phenomenal. Make up team, Jacob Elordi and Sofia Coppola also deserve genuine praise. But my biggest praise for the film lies in the fact that it managed to make a great story without creating a narrative centered around a specific endeavor or event. It’s just a collection of connected events, yet each of them reveals something interesting about the characters or the world they inhabit.

7. Anatomy of a Fall. Probably the most down-to-earth film in the group. It leaves you with a lack of closure, a feeling of strong ambiguity and uncertainty. Which I suppose was the directorial intent. Great performances from everyone (though the one I’d nominate Sandra Hüller for was in Glazer’s, not Triet’s movie), a compelling mystery, and the courtroom scenes… Oh, they were a fucking blast. It was like watching a dead-serious, prosaic, more sincere version of Ace Attorney. Just as much entertainment and dynamism in the scenes, but without AA’s crazy energy. Best hallmarks of the movie’s quality are the fact I could only nitpick the slightly underwhelming cinematography and the grating 50 Cent track.

6. Speak No Evil. You’re probably surprised to see it up here, but I’mma own it. Not only does Speak No Evil use its vague premise to create a ticking bomb of a plot that once goes off, it fucking TEARS the screen to shreds. After that, it also becomes a fucking MASTERCLASS in tension, my whole body was there ready to give out any minute once our protagonists realized the deep shit they were in. Special accolades to James McAvoy, Mackenzie Davis and Scoot McNairy as far as performances go. There are also some well-conveyed themes about generational trauma poisoning people’s souls, the dangers of the inability to say “no” and the depths some will go to justify their actions. Fantastic filmmaking.

5. The Apprentice. I have to applaud Ali Abbasi for managing to keep the story infused with the typical Trumpian undertones of vanity, hedonism and rapaciousness and not losing the emotion in it. The movie forges the spear of depressive truths about Trump’s world and stabs you with it repeatedly. But eventually, the stab just hurts you somewhere lower, existentially. You don’t even feel for Donald anymore, if you ever did in the first place. All that’s left is Roy and Ivana, and they’re both royally screwed. As is America, if the final shot and real life are anything to go by. But hey, at least we got a three-composer-collaboration of a score that is both cohesive and fucking excellent in quality. How about that? (Nominate Dirkov, Holmes and Irvine for the Oscar, you COWARDS!)

4. Conclave. The one movie where my firm expectations regarding its quality were thoroughly fulfilled. When you look at it as a whole, you may come to a conclusion it’s like Oppenheimer, but in a church setting. I mean, I sure did get the impression, considering the sharp, visually clean and orderly directing/editing style, the rhythmically oppressive yet graceful score and the raw yet elegant acting of the performers involved. Fiennes earned his Best Actor nom, no doubt, but I’m secretly hoping for a Best Supporting nom for Carlos Diehz as Vincent Benítez. He sold the man’s honesty, kindness and timidness with such conviction I only doubted it due to a fakeout Berger planted last minute. As far as their characters’ innocence goes, this year only Cailee Spaeny matched Diehz. The movie plays like a purebred conspiracy thriller, questioning everyone’s motives, infusing paranoia and uncertainty into every scene. You have ZERO fucking confusion about the extent to which the Holy See lost its way, because certain frames just scream “This can’t be made right, can IT?!” But the movie’s true genius lies in its twist, because it reframes both the movie’s themes and characters in ways never explicitly stated, yet hard-hitting once inferred. This would’ve been a masterpiece had the secondary antagonist been more fleshed out.

3. Dune Part 2. Denis Villeneuve and Greg Fraser ain’t skipped a single goddamn beat on the production. Hans Zimmer did, but even with more repetition his musical material is top-notch. The movie sure takes a while to get going, but I have nothing but applause for it for how effectively it establishes its antagonist (really crappy how they did very little with him in the end, though), and how the Harkonnenian clusterfuck on Arrakis beautifully falls apart with time. When Paul ascends to Prophet level and goes sicko mode on the establishment, the movie kicks into its highest gear on all levels. We understand everyone’s position in the conflict and what they’re willing to do to achieve their goals. Which makes it so frustrating Emperor Shaddam and Feyd-Rautha do not get nearly enough time to have their political and philosophical perspectives be expressed. But still, the movie is lethally efficient when it comes to… Chani and her disillusionment arc. Not only is she an excellent mirror to the bloodthirsty Gurney and the increasingly fanatical Stilgar, Zendaya turns in some incredibly believable acting that had me rooting for her with no questions. I can’t wait for Messiah, and Shai-Hulud bless Villeneuve’s team!

2. The Zone of Interest. That movie hits on a deeper level. I did not actually comprehend what I saw until I was back home from the theater, and that’s when I started crying. The movie is indeed viciously effective in how much it can tear your heart out without you seeing or realizing it in the first place. Insanely beautiful cinematography, and the score… 3 tracks in the whole movie, yet they’re all fucking Oscar-worthy. Great acting. And the theme of invisibility… it’s clear enough you know what’s the context Glazer applies it to, but also subtle enough everyone will have ideas about what it means to say and which other contexts it can be applied to in real life. Probably the best candidate for 2023’s BP barring Oppenheimer.

1. The Substance. If The Zone of Interest is bold, then Coralie Fargeat’s project is BOLD. Not really in its theme, but in how it’s executed. It’s an attack on the senses, in both a good and bad way. The screen sucks you in and shits you out time and time again. You’re in an abusive relationship with it, just like Liz Sparkle is with The Substance/Sue. Huge props for the trailer, because it fooled me so hard into thinking we’d be getting an individual v individuals/society conflict, while we got an individual v self conflict. I was watching with all my interest as Liz and Sue tried to undermine each other yet being constantly forced to rely on one another, as the situation got worse and worse. It’s not that a person is trying to destroy themself, it’s how extreme the degradation is. The movie knows no fucking restraint sometimes, and in those times the terror can be mixed with perverse glee and karmic satisfaction, gives those times coincide with character punishment, but when it manages to show restraint, the horror stings more profoundly. In 2024 few things in cinema managed to scare the crap out of me, and one of them was Sue smiling hysterically to a mirror as several of her teeth were falling out. The Substance thrives in the hateful and the loving, the gross and the tantalizing, the sinister and the kind. At its heart it’s a story of a woman who could not forgive herself for something she had no control over. You really see it in 3 scenes only, but those 3 scenes are what’s enough to make the movie sincere. Moore and Qualley are insanely convincing. God! Just give it the BP already!

All in all, a great year. I won’t say it’s superior to 2023 or anything, but I think I’d rate The Substance on the same level as Babylon (a delayee from 2022 that topped the 2023 chart), which I suppose is saying something. But now I know one thing for sure. Cinema has become something I’ll probably love forever."	/r/movies/comments/1hssbxd/looking_back_on_2024_a_cinematic_year_in_review/	https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hssbxd/looking_back_on_2024_a_cinematic_year_in_review/	
oppenheimer	TrueFilm	17utwry	1699934893	Has the fast-paced and short-length social media entertainment influenced film pacing?	"Just posing a question about a trend I've noticed about  modern cinema that has been critically acclaimed (I only include critically acclaimed to show that these aren't random pieces of work that no one cares about). 

What I mean by my question is simply, shorter scenes with lots of information and less time for the audience to see images or sit with information. I just saw Oppenheimer and I expected to go into a beautifully shot slow paced film that went into the mind of a scientist that was at an ethical crossroads and instead I got what felt like 4 second scenes with quick cuts to the next and to the next and to the next, etc. with as much information as you can possibly handle in the shortest amount of time.  I had sort of kept these thoughts to myself and my partner mentioned the same thing to me when we were done watching. 

I had also noticed it with the Elvis movie. I know these both happen to be biopic but I actually don't think that part is relevant. Just curious if anyone has had any similar thoughts to this? I am wondering if Instagram reels and TikTok is actually influencing the way major productions are handling their film to some degree.
