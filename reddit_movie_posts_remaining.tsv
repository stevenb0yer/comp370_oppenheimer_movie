barbie	movies	1no02zp	1758578776	September 19-21 Box Office Recap – Despite collapsing 75%, 'Demon Slayer: Infinity Castle' becomes the biggest anime title domestically ($104.7M) and worldwide ($555M). 'Him' opens with a so-so $13.2M, while 'A Big Bold Beautiful Journey' flops with an anemic $3.2M against a $45M budget.

With two newcomers failing to meet expectations, ***Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba – The Movie: Infinity Castle*** held the top spot despite its steep second weekend drop. ***Him*** had a so-so debut, but its opening was quite front-loaded, suggesting the future is not bright for the film. But the real loser this weekend was Sony's ***A Big Bold Beautiful Journey***, which had one of the worst debuts for any film playing at 3,000 theaters.

The Top 10 earned a combined $60.1 million this weekend, which was down 19.5% from last year, when ***Beetlejuice Beetlejuice*** repeated at #1 for a third weekend and ***Transformers One*** flopped.

Keeping the top spot, ***Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba – The Movie: Infinity Castle*** earned $17.3 million this weekend. That's a brutal 75% drop, although drops like these are common in anime films, especially fan-driven ones. Still, it's a steeper drop than ***Mugen Train*** (69.5%).

But with $104.7 million domestically, ***Infinity Castle*** has officially become the biggest anime title in the country, finally dethroning ***Pokémon: The First Movie*** ($85.7 million), although ***Pokémon*** is still ahead of it in terms of inflation ($166.7 million). As it loses IMAX and other PLF screens this week, it will continue dropping hard.

In second place, Universal's ***Him*** debuted with $13.2 million in 3,168 theaters. This debut is below other football-themed films, but it's hard to find comparisons given that this is a sports horror film, which is very rare to find. 

The film cost $27 million, so a $13.2 million debut isn't bad. The problem, however, is how front-loaded it was: Friday ($6.4 million) represented a massive 49% of the weekend's gross, while Saturday and Sunday saw steep drops, falling to third place. That's why this debut is just so-so.

There's no doubt that Universal bet high on this, but primarily because of producer Jordan Peele's involvement. His name was plastered all over the posters and trailers, leading many to believe this was his new directorial effort. While that's misleading, you usually use your biggest asset as the selling point. And it worked; with the exception of Marlon Wayans (who isn't really a box office draw), the cast and crew are not familiar to the public. If Universal ditched Peele's name from the marketing, perhaps the film would miss $10 million.

When marketing began, they sold a very efficient premise: *Whiplash* meets football meets horror. That's a very interesting concept, especially when sport horror films are incredibly rare in theaters. As the film got closer to release, however, Universal leaned more into supernatural elements while highlighting even further Peele's involvement. That felt a bit desperate, but again, you use your best asset. Although in this case, the reviews did not help: it's sitting at a very poor 29% on RT. Considering Peele's producing credits are often well-received, that was a huge red flag.

According to Universal, 51% of the audience was male, and 64% was 25 and over. Critics slammed the film, and unfortunately, the audience agreed: they gave it a horrible ""C–"" on CinemaScore, even for horror that's bad. With poor word of mouth and a front-loaded debut, it's clear the film is gonna fall off a cliff very quickly. There's a very strong chance it will finish below $30 million domestically. And that spells flop territory, as football isn't popular outside America (check the overseas section for this film).

After its horrible second weekend drop, ***The Conjuring: Last Rites*** had another rough drop, thanks to ***Him***. This time, it fell 52%, earning $12.2 million this weekend. The film has amassed $150.5 million, officially becoming the biggest film in the franchise. If it continues dropping like this, it might miss $180 million.

***Downton Abbey: The Grand Finale*** added $6.4 million this weekend. That's a brutal 65% drop, far worse than any of the prior films. Through 10 days, the film has earned $31.7 million, and it's now guaranteed to miss $50 million domestically.

Despite some horror competition, ***The Long Walk*** held very well on its second weekend. It dipped 47%, adding $6.2 million. Pretty good, considering 50% or more is usually the norm. Through 10 days, the film has made $22.6 million, and it should finish with around $35 million if it keeps holding well.

Debuting in sixth place, Sony's ***A Big Bold Beautiful Journey*** flopped with an anemic $3.2 million in 3,330 theaters. That's the sixth worst debut for any film playing at over 3,000 theaters. Incredibly depressing fact: Margot Robbie's other film, ***Babylon***, is also the eighth worst debut ($3.6 million in 3,343 theaters). Which means she has starred in the two worst debuts at 3,300 theaters. It's also the second worst wide debut for Colin Farrell, only ahead of ***Voyagers*** ($1.3 million).

This debut also translates to a pathetic $977 per-theater average. If each theater was playing this film in 5 screenings at an average $11.31 ticket price, that means that there were just 5 people at each screening. Sony bought the film for $50 million, setting it as a $45 million production. Yet the film couldn't open to 10% of that figure. That's one of the worst ROI debuts for a wide release. How could it fare this badly? 

Romance films are definitely profitable. But mixing romance with fantasy is a niche market; some people don't like that combination. And the concept (doors taking the characters on a journey to the past) just didn't connect with audiences. Fantasy dramas are just difficult to pull off, especially at the box office.

Sony had the film set for May, but they decided to move it to this weekend, hoping to capitalize on weak competition. But the film simply lacked buzz compared to other titles this month. And while Margot Robbie and Colin Farrell are recognizable names, they're not exactly huge draws: Robbie has starred in a lot of flops prior to ***Barbie***, and Farrell has been part of many panned flops for the past 20 years. So their presence doesn't guarantee success (then again, who does?). But the real nail in the coffin was the reviews. Adult dramas need acclaim just to stand a chance, but the film's poor 37% on RT dissuaded those interested from checking out.

According to Sony, 59% of the audience was female, and 76% was 25 and over. They gave it a poor ""B–"" on CinemaScore, quite rough for a romance title. With such a poor debut, zero buzz and incoming competition, the film will not last long in theaters. It would be a surprise if the film made it past $10 million domestically. That's absolutely horrible.

In seventh place, Angel Studios' ***The Senior*** earned just $2.6 million in 2,405 theaters. That's one of the worst debuts for a film playing in those theaters. Even with an ""A"" on CinemaScore, it will disappear quickly from theaters.

The 30th anniversary re-release of ***Toy Story*** dropped 59%, earning $1.4 million. That takes its lifetime gross to $198.4 million.

In ninth place, Fathom Events' re-release of ***Howl's Moving Castle*** earned $1.4 million this weekend. That takes its lifetime total to $10.5 million.

Rounding out the Top 10 was Fathom Events' ***Sight &amp; Sound Presents: NOAH Live!***, which made $1.3 million from 933 theaters.

Outside the Top 10, ***Weapons*** dropped 54% and added $1.2 million this weekend. That takes its domestic total to $149.7 million.

***Freakier Friday*** dropped 46% for a $1.1 million weekend. The film's domestic total stands at $92.9 million, and it's now certain to miss $100 million domestically.

MUBI expanded ***The History of Sound*** to 552 theaters, but it could only muster $309,072. It's unlikely it can perform much better than this.

#**OVERSEAS**

It is official: with $555 million worldwide, ***Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba – The Movie: Infinity Castle*** has become the biggest anime title in history, dethroning ***Mugen Train***. It came from $36 million overseas this weekend, with big debuts in France ($8.6M) and Germany ($8.2M). The biggest markets are Japan ($269M), South Korea ($37.3M), Taiwan ($25M), Mexico ($15.1M), Hong Kong ($12.4M), India ($8.1M), the UK ($7.5M), and Indonesia ($7.3M). By next week, it should cross $600 million.

***The Conjuring: Last Rites*** added $28.3 million overseas, taking its worldwide total to $399.3 million (so damn close man). The best markets are Mexico ($26.4M), the UK ($20.3M), Brazil ($15.3M), France ($14.6M) and Germany ($12.7M). While it won't hit $500 million, it should still safely hit $450 million worldwide.

***Downton Abbey: The Grand Finale*** added $8.3 million overseas, for a $59.4 million worldwide total. Its best markets are the UK ($13.9M), France ($2.6M), Australia ($2.4M), Netherlands ($1.9M) and Finland ($1.2M). It still has some markets left.

***A Big Bold Beautiful Journey*** also had horrible news in the rest of the world. It debuted with just $4.5 million overseas, for a very poor $7.7 million worldwide total. Even though that's just 42 markets, that's still an underwhelming debut and doesn't point to a bright future.

***Him*** debuted in 25 markets, but it could only earn an abysmal $258K, for a very underwhelming $13.5 million worldwide debut. The result is not surprising; football is not popular outside America, so films focused on that lean heavily on the domestic side. The only markets where it has a chance to perform solidly are Mexico, the UK and Brazil (markets where the NFL is popular), all of which open in October. But don't expect any of them to save the film.

#**FILMS THAT ENDED THEIR RUN THIS WEEK**

Movie | Release Date | Studio | Domestic Opening | Domestic Total | Worldwide Total | Budget |
----------|----------|----------|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:
*The Naked Gun* | Aug/1 | Paramount | $16,805,560 | $52,647,396 | $101,847,396 | $42M
*Nobody 2* | Aug/15 | Universal | $9,251,190 | $21,604,985 | $39,299,926 | $25M

- Paramount's ***The Naked Gun*** has closed with $52 million domestically and $101 million worldwide. Not exactly a smash hit, but not a bad amount. Especially considering how comedies are struggling in theaters, and how people were hesitant over having someone replace Leslie Nielsen here. But with such good reception, there's clearly some interest here. If it makes a killing on home media, it should spawn sequels.

- Nobody was interested in ***Nobody 2***, which closed with just $21 million domestically and $39 million worldwide. Somehow, it managed to earn less than the original, which opened in far worse conditions. Perhaps it's a sign that there's not much interest in this franchise.

#**THIS WEEKEND**

Three newcomers arrive in wide release.

The big release is WB's ***One Battle After Another***, the newest film from Paul Thomas Anderson. Headlined by Leonardo DiCaprio, it follows a group of ex-revolutionaries who reunite to rescue the daughter of one of their own after an enemy resurfaces. The film has enjoyed incredible reviews (97% on RT, 96 on Metacritic) and WB even secured IMAX screenings for the film. WB is certainly enjoying an incredible streak at the box office. But with the exception of ***Boogie Nights*** and ***There Will Be Blood***, PTA's films are known for flopping at the box office. On its advantage, this is his first film playing at more than 3,000 theaters and securing PLF screenings. But it's still carrying a high $130 million budget, which means it's gonna need over $300 million worldwide just to break even. Pressure is very high on this one. If the opening weekend begins with a ""2"", that's definitely gonna be a very disappointing figure. It'll need to make a big first impression.

DreamWorks is also releasing ***Gabby's Dollhouse: The Movie***, a continuation of the Netflix series. There aren't many options for kids right now, given that ***The Bad Guys 2*** is almost 2 months old and on its way out of theaters. Perhaps it can surprise.

And Lionsgate is also releasing ***The Strangers – Chapter 2***, almost one year and a half after ***Chapter 1*** hit theaters. Despite its poor reception, it still made $48 million. But with such a gap and very little good will for this ""trilogy"", it's very unlikely it can reach those numbers.

barbie	movies	1jtyamn	1744065127	April 4-6 Box Office Recap: 'A Minecraft Movie' massively over-performs, debuting with a colossal $162.7 million domestically. Worldwide, it earned $313.4 million, the second biggest debut for a video game movie.	"https://preview.redd.it/3kitircrohte1.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=92e79a33892ca9682412307a2d502234da9c8839

After some very weak months, the box office finally picked up steam with April.

And that's practically all because of ***A Minecraft Movie***, which overcame months of negative buzz to deliver a record opening weekend for a video game adaptation, as well as the biggest debut of the year.

The Top 10 earned a combined $190.8 million this weekend. That's up a massive 135.3% from last year, when ***Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire*** stayed on top, while ***Monkey Man*** and ***The First Omen*** underwhelmed.

Debuting atop, WB's ***A Minecraft Movie*** surpassed all expectations, earning a colossal $162.7 million in 4,263 theaters. That's even bigger than WB's ***Barbie*** ($162 million), and it's only behind ***Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2*** ($169 million) for the studio's biggest debut. The opening is also higher than the previous video game record, ***The Super Mario Bros. Movie*** ($146 million), although ***Mario*** debuted on a Wednesday and burned off demand.

Simply put, it's a fantastic film. Especially after months of negative buzz surrounding the film's trailers. And a much needed win for WB after a slate of disappointing performers like ***Joker***, ***War of the Rohirrim***, ***Companion*** and ***The Alto Knights***.

Back in September 2024, when the teaser trailer debuted, the film earned poor reception, with many criticizing the VFX. To win over audiences for the other trailers, studio marketing suits added more VFX and quelled rabid fans by conveying that their Minecraft will stay true to the game. But that's perhaps the key; people will talk badly about a product, but that buzz translates into awareness, which builds into curiosity.

Of course, not all negative buzz translates into curiosity (***Snow White*** waving in the distance). But the advantage for this film is simply ***Minecraft***. Despite the belief that the game lost relevance years ago, the stats say otherwise; ***Minecraft*** is the best-selling video game of all time, with over 300 million copies sold and nearly 170 million monthly active players as of 2024. Clearly, there's already an audience awaiting for a film, and they happily paid tickets for this. Even lukewarm reviews (48% on RT) didn't dissuade fans from checking it out.

According to Warner Bros., 67% of the audience was male, and 78% was under 25 years old. They gave it a middling ""B+"" on CinemaScore, which is very mediocre for a family film. While word of mouth among children is very positive, adults are less thrilled with the film. We'll see in subsequent weeks how much it drops, but for now, a $450 million domestic total is in the cards for ***A Minecraft Movie***.

Last week's champ ***A Working Man*** added $7.3 million this weekend. That's a 53% drop, which is slightly worse than ***Beekeeper***'s 48% drop. Of course, that film had incredibly weak competition, but it's a sign that the film might not be able to leg out as hoped. Through 10 days, the film has amassed $27.8 million, and it should finish with around $40 million domestically.

In third place, ***The Chosen: Last Supper — Part 2*** earned $6.9 million this weekend. That's down 42% from ***Part 1***'s performance last week. Let's see how ***Part 3*** fares this weekend.

With the arrival of a big blockbuster, ***Snow White*** had another terrible drop this weekend. It fell a rough 59%, earning just $5.9 million this weekend. The film's legs appear to be running out. Through 17 days, the film has earned a terrible $77.3 million and it's gonna finish with less than $90 million domestically. That's absolutely pathetic.

Blumhouse's ***The Woman in the Yard*** added $4.5 million this weekend. That's a 52% drop, which isn't that bad considering the film's poor word of mouth. Through 10 days, the film has earned $16.6 million, and it should pass $20 million by next week.

***Death of a Unicorn*** earned $2.6 million this weekend. That's a 53% drop, which is quite rough for a comedy. Through 10 days, the film has earned just $10.7 million and it will struggle to get to $15 million by the end of its run.

With the arrival of ***Part 2***, ***The Chosen: Last Supper — Part 1*** collapsed a horrible 84% this weekend, earning just $1.8 million. That took its domestic lifetime to $17.9 million after 10 days.

There was another wide release this weekend, Neon's ***Hell of a Summer***. Debuting in 1,255 theaters, it earned an okay $1.7 million. With weak word of mouth and horror/thriller competition on the way, it's gonna disappear quickly from theaters.

In ninth place, Bleecker Street's ***The Friend*** expanded to 1,237 theaters and earned $1.6 million this weekend.

Rounding up the Top 10 was ***Captain America: Brave New World***, which fell 54% and added $1.3 million this weekend. The film's domestic total stands at $199 million and it will crack the $200 million milestone sometime this week.

#**OVERSEAS**

***A Minecraft Movie*** also took over the rest of the world. The film earned a huge $150.7 million overseas, for a $313.4 million worldwide debut. That's the second biggest debut for a video game movie, behind ***Mario***. The best debuts were in the UK ($19.9M), China ($14.5M), Mexico ($11.2M), Germany ($10.6M) and Australia ($8.3M). It still has other markets left, including Japan. We'll see if the film can be strong enough to hit the $1 billion mark.

***Snow White*** is running out of steam and it's already its third week. It added just $9 million overseas, which takes its worldwide total to a terrible $168.6 million.

#**FILMS THAT ENDED THEIR RUN THIS WEEK**

None.

#**THIS WEEKEND**

We're getting FOUR wide releases, and none stand a chance in dethroning ***Minecraft***.

The first is 20th Century Studios' ***The Amateur***, which stars Rami Malek as a CIA cryptographer who seeks revenge against his wife's killers. With ***A Working Man*** slowing down, this could be a main attraction for old-school action fans.

Another release is Universal/Blumhouse's ***Drop***, which stars Meghann Fahy as a widow who is contacted by a stranger to kill her date, or her family will be murdered. The film already premiered at SXSW and it has received strong reviews (89% on RT). Can it be the hit that Blumhouse wants and needs?

Another is A24's ***Warfare***, which follows in real-time a platoon of Navy SEALs on a mission through insurgent territory in 2006. It's directed by both Ray Mendoza and Alex Garland (although the latter states his role is more secondary), and it has earned great reviews so far (93% on RT). It's unreasonable to expect numbers similar to ***Civil War***, but perhaps it could be a surprise breakout for A24.

And finally, there's Angel Studios' ***The King of Kings***, an animated film about the life of Jesus Christ. Angel Studios has delivered a big marketing for the film, and pre-sales are reportedly strong here. Maybe it could surprise.

barbie	movies	1jqc1tx	1743664824	Is there a movie who trully managed to change people's mind ?	"A common critic for most movies with a social or political subject very under the nose (typically ""Don't look up"" or ""Barbie"") is they are just preaching the converted. Basically those who should see it will not because it's blatant that the movie is at the opposite of their political view, and the few who will see it will feel (rightfully) insulted and then just be conforted in their convictions. The ones who will see it and be receptive to the subject are at 99% those who already agree with the vision of the movie in a first place.

Ultimately that those movies aren't made to change people's mind, but are more here to provide to a category of people a feeling of self-congratulation for being ""so smart"" (or at least less dumb than the other side) while the others will just feel personally attacked.

And i mean, sure ? It's true that movies like that aren't something which will developp your critical spirit and their targeted audience is obviously those who are agree with it in a first place, but i don't see how it makes them really different from the others movies ? Almost every movie tries to bring some feeling of comfort to their audience, not to challenge them, and i don't think that's a flaw. In quite the crazy world we're leaving in, it feels good to not feel alone, and if to watch a movie like that will not make you smarter, it's often a welcomed moral support to receive some validation. It's certainly a quality if a movie can give you that. Plus, i agree that those kind of movie will obviously not make a 180° change of course in those who share a different vision from it and saw it, but a change in your mind is usually progressive by being exposed at repetition to different ideas than yours, even if the exposition is aggressive. It's not a big contribution but it's a contribution nevertheless.   

Anyway, i think this critic of those type of movie would be more valid if there are actually some movies which did a really good job at challenging their audience. Are there really some movies who managed to creat a change in a significant part of their audience ?"	/r/movies/comments/1jqc1tx/is_there_a_movie_who_trully_managed_to_change/	https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1jqc1tx/is_there_a_movie_who_trully_managed_to_change/

 I just wanna know what is okay for me to and not to do i don't wanna mansplain im sorry if I do and im just afraid of the real world in general and I need this list because I very like really sensitive through trauma and brain issues so said my sisters and mom, they are probably right because they're women.

I'm just scared i might say or do the wrong stuff to women also I almost cried just like 30 minutes ago because my sister said I over talk her and that i always try to finish her jokes or cut her off a lot, im afraid ill be alone for the rest of my life.

barbie	movies	1fek54m	1726086177	"The ""Archeological Significance"" of Movie Movies"	"Before I start this, I'm not defending those terrible ""we're repeating a thing another movie said and adding sex, profanity, and/or bodily functions and calling it a joke"" ""parody movies"" that were popular from 2000-2015 (epic movie, disaster movie, superhero movie, vampires suck, etc.) and saying we should still have them, they were pretty much universally bad and we're better off without them ruining the word ""spoof"" and ""parody,"" but I think it's a little irresponsible to say ""and nothing of value was lost,"" because I think there is a ""pop culture archeology interpretation of the time it was made"" that can be observed in them. The other day I was watching The Hungover Games (a ""parody"" of The Hunger Games and The Hangover) as just kind of background noise, and the thing I noticed is that this movie was a collection of every movie and trend that was popular around 2014 (the hunger games and the hangover, but also Ted, The Muppet Movie, Avatar, the Hobbit movies, weird Johnny Depp characters including Tonto from the Lone Ranger movie, and others I'm forgetting), and kind of ONLY movies that were popular at the time, nothing older than like 5 years, and it reminded me of what the cinematic landscape was back 10 years ago. After noticing that it hit me that I had a similar feeling when watching Epic Movie recently, it too name dropped basically everything that was popular around 2007, and for the most part only the newer things, and as I thought about it the same could be said for the others I'm familiar with. So now I'm reminded of a thing an archeologist guest speaker told my class once, ""archeology is the study of a civilization's garbage and piecing together what life was like for those people based on what they used and discarded."" These movies are definitely garbage and were discarded after serving their purpose (if they aren't painfully bad they're immediately forgotten), and for me at least I can step back and say ""yes, I now remember that was a popular thing at the time as was this other thing.""

That's my thesis, now for the discussion part since I need a flair. Now that the ""movie movie"" is largely an artifact of the past, what would a ""current year movie"" be? What recent movies and trends had enough cultural significance to be part of a modern terrible ""parody"" movie? I know Barbie, Oppenheimer, Minions, and Morbius would need to be a part of it, maybe also Deadpool and Wolverine, but what else? Also, what would the title be? Since all my picks have memes with them it would be ""Meme Movie."""	/r/movies/comments/1fek54m/the_archeological_significance_of_movie_movies/	https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1fek54m/the_archeological_significance_of_movie_movies/

By “product” I mean something that’s mass produced and sold to a wide audience. *Toy Story* wouldn’t count, even though there are some real-life toys in it, because it’s just about toys in general. *Barbie* counts because it’s based on a specific toy. A film about the origin of fried chicken wouldn’t count, even though that is a specific food, but a film based on the origin of KFC (god forbid) would since it’s a certain brand of fried chicken. Films based on books, TV shows, comics, and video games don’t count, either, despite all of those technically being products.	/r/movies/comments/1cumh8o/what_was_the_first_movie_that_was_based_on_a/	https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1cumh8o/what_was_the_first_movie_that_was_based_on_a/
barbie	movies	1csppfw	1715792164	What does a movie producer actually do?	"This is a question that I have tried to figure out for years, and have never found a good resource on.

Really, my question is about creative and financial control of movies. Back in the 1950s, you had the studio system. Studios were pretty much factories that made movies. They owned the sets, the cameras, the scripts, the whole shebang. Actors were literally just employees. They would show up one week and be told ""this week, you're acting in a cowboy movie. Next week, you're in a space movie."" Producers were the guys who decided what kind of movies to make. They hired and fired screenwriters, actors, directors, poster artists etc. Therefore, they had creative control over the movie. Sure, if you were a good screenwriter you were more likely to be hired again, but ultimately the studio had the power.

At some point in the 1970s, the studio system broke down. This is where it gets confusing for me. The best explanation I could ever find was that successful creative directors (Stanley Kubrick, George Lucas etc) became more like movie stars. Their name on the poster could draw in crowds and sell the movie. They leveraged this power to get much more creative control over the movies they were making. Suddenly, the studio couldn't just say ""this movie needs more kid characters and a fun talking monkey! Write one in!"" Directors could insist on bringing in their preferred screenwriters, actors etc. 

At this point you have a conflict of control. Presumably the studio are still financing the movie, but they are handing over creative control to someone else. I have heard lots of stories about studio interference on movies. Is this interference coming from producers? Do producers still work for the studio? Or did they form themselves into little independent production companies, who the studio hire like contractors?

Today, I have no idea who really finances and really has creative control over a movie any more. When you watch any mid budget movie, there are half a dozen production companies credited before the main title. Are these companies helping to finance the movie? If so, do they get some say over the script?

Is an auteur-driven movie like Oppenheimer produced in a very different way from something like Barbie? 

I appreciate this is a very long and complex question, but if anyone knows any good resources that explain how all this works, it would be hugely appreciated."	/r/movies/comments/1csppfw/what_does_a_movie_producer_actually_do/	https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1csppfw/what_does_a_movie_producer_actually_do/
barbie	movies	1c6ssj7	1713408692	Cross-generational Movie Recommendations	"Looking for movie suggestions to satisfy the following group of viewers:

- Grampa - loves movies with 'good lines' (Terminator, Princess Bride)
- Gramma - like happy movies, hates violence, medical or sports genres (liked the greatest showman, watches all the housewives shows)
- Dad - loves action movies, superhero movies
- Mom - loves Sci fi, dystopian themes, open to almost anything as long as there's not too much gore, violence ot sex
- Teen girl - loves standard teen content: musicals, vampires and also medical dramas (Hunger games, new amsterdam, Buffy)
- Preteen girl - loves action, hates romance - but surprisingly loved the titanic, also enjoys the Simpsons and Ghostbusters. 

What did we try?
Terminator - good choice
Barbie - meh - did not hit the mark
Chicken run - too slapstick, not enough lines
Home Alone - good choice
The Grinch (Jim Carey version).- too kiddy

barbie	movies	1bs055s	1711854074	Strong female characters: Before Barbie and Little Women, Greta Gerwig directed Lady Bird, which I think is a remarkable feminist movie. What films you've watched that also have strong female characters or do a good job of showing things from the female perspective?	"There is nothing wrong with making movies that will appeal to men, especially if they are more likely to go to the movies. But many movies that are even directed by women or said to be from the perspective of women, often end up showing what men desire or how the world appears to them. In other words, they show what men *think* is how women view things.

I'm interested in movies that actually show things from the female perspective. Or ones that have strong female characters. As in the title, a recent example is Greta Gerwig who directed several acclaimed movies, including Lady Bird and Barbie. Other examples?"	/r/movies/comments/1bs055s/strong_female_characters_before_barbie_and_little/	https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1bs055s/strong_female_characters_before_barbie_and_little/

Hey  guys! I love doing projects like this just for fun. I love rating and  ranking movies and doing brackets. It's a real sweet spot for me. I had  this idea the other day so I figured I should pursue it. How this came  to be was that I took a look at the most popular movies on Letterboxd,  then I split them up into the 8 genres you see above. The seeds were  simply determined by how high they were on Letterboxd's popularity list.  There was a little bit of fudging with the genres just to make  everything fit, but I don't believe there is anything egregiously out of  place. For those who want to see all of the seeds broken down, here  they are...

Background -  
Hey guys! I love doing projects like this just for fun. I love rating and ranking movies and doing brackets. It's a real sweet spot for me. I had this idea the other day so I figured I should pursue it. How this came to be was that I took a look at the most popular movies on Letterboxd, then I split them up into the 8 genres you see above. The seeds were simply determined by how high they were on Letterboxd's popularity list. There was a little bit of fudging with the genres just to make everything fit, but I don't believe there is anything egregiously out of place. For those who want to see all of the seeds broken down, here they are...

Hey guys! I love doing projects like this just for fun. I love rating and ranking movies and doing brackets. It's a real sweet spot for me. I had this idea the other day so I figured I should pursue it. How this came to be was that I took a look at the most popular movies on Letterboxd, then I split them up into the 8 genres you see above. The seeds were simply determined by how high they were on Letterboxd's popularity list. There was a little bit of fudging with the genres just to make everything fit, but I don't believe there is anything egregiously out of place. For those who want to see all of the seeds broken down, here they are...

When I watched the movie, I, like so many others, was a little disappointed and felt like it was in a million different directions and fell flat. One thing I thought was the idea of Barbie discovering mortality seemed worth more time. Like the scene w the old lady at the bus station. And I would have done more showing less telling w a lot of the themes.

barbie	movies	1avbdqs	1708412245	Most fashionable movie?	"Heyo

Just wanted to ask what you guys think is the most fashionable movie in terms of what you would wear? Not necessarily the movie with the most out there costumes (like Barbie, but if you are gonna wear their fits go ahead and rock it!) but a movie that you'd use as an inspiration for what type of style of clothing you want to wear and look like? Some examples might be the devil wears prada or the age old Bond style."	/r/movies/comments/1avbdqs/most_fashionable_movie/	https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1avbdqs/most_fashionable_movie/
barbie	movies	1al9ses	1707330312	To Give An Idea on How Reliant films are becoming on VFX, LOTR Fellowship of the Ring, a 3hr Fantasy Film, had less than 600 VFX Shots, Fast X has over 1,000, John Wick 4 has over 1,500	"It’s fascinating to see that a 3 hour fantasy movie made over 20 years ago has 1/3rd of the VFX shots of just a regular action movie like John Wick 4. 

The first Jurassic Park movie had less than 60 VFX shots. Jurassic World 1-3 each film has well over 1,000. 

I don’t want to give the impression I’m against CGI or anything but I do think when you are making a movie that doesn’t have trolls, balrogs or dinosaurs, or mountains of doom, yet you have well over twice the amount of VFX shots, it might be time to ask yourself why. John Wick 4 a lot of it went into recreating cities like Paris. 

I do see audiences complaining about CGI usage a lot. And movie studios have even started to lie about their use(Looking at you Top Gun 2). The producers of Barbie even went as far to as alter behind the scenes pictures and video to hide blue screens. 

It does seem audiences respond to when things are done for real. Often times CGI has a tell. And when there are so many shots &amp; artists are being overworked and underpaid, maybe it’s time Hollywood reconsider how best to use this terrific storytelling tool."	/r/movies/comments/1al9ses/to_give_an_idea_on_how_reliant_films_are_becoming/	https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1al9ses/to_give_an_idea_on_how_reliant_films_are_becoming/

barbie	movies	1ad3ooh	1706451667	"Hot Take: I Think Barbie is (Intentionally?) a Critique of Rich ""Girlboss"" Feminism"	"A bit late to the discussion, but only just saw Barbie, and I feel like one message of the movie is a critique of rich (white?) feminism and the need for intersectionality.  As I understand the movie:

1. Barbie world is meant to be a mirror image of the real world.  So whereas women are oppressed by the patriarchy in the real world, Kens are oppressed by the matriarchy in Barbie world (or, if not oppressed, second class citizens).
2. America Ferrara's character, Gloria, has at least some control/impact on Barbie world.  It is her negative thoughts that introduce the fear of mortality into stereotypical Barbie, and I believe she notes that Weird Barbie looks the way she does because Gloria did things to the doll in real life.  It may even be that all of Barbie world is an extension of her psyche and that there are in fact multiple Barbie worlds, each created by a real world girl's imagination (it was unclear to me what the case may be).  But regardless, it would appear that Gloria is at least complicit, if not an active participant, in Ken's oppression in Barbie World.
3. In the real world, Gloria's daughter is in private school (she wears a school uniform), she lives in a multi-million dollar home in Los Angeles, drives a brand new car with all the options, and works on the top floor of a large multinational company as some sort of executive assistant (so not a nothing job), but can only see herself as oppressed because she is not actually in the boardroom (which is true! That is oppression!).
4. There is no discussion of class in the movie (all the Barbies are fabulously wealthy), and while the Barbies are diverse, race is also not mentioned.  In the movie, all oppression is viewed solely thru the lens of patriarchy and feminism, not intersectionally.
5. At no point does Gloria show any awareness of her own role as an oppressor, whether in the real world or of Ken(s) in Barbie world.  In fact, when Ken rebels against the oppression that Gloria was at the very least complicit in, she works against him to restore the status quo.  And while Gloria apologizes to Weird Barbie for making her look weird (I could be misremembering this), she never apologizes to Ken for her actions towards him.

I don't know, I'm not sure Gerwig intended it, but it seems to me that this is a bit of a parody of the strain of girlboss feminism that thinks an oppressive society can be dismantled simply by making more women CEOs.

Or I could have just been way too high when I watched (the colors were pretty though).

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: I rewatched a couple of scenes, and I was wrong about the private school.  The daughter and friends are just wearing very, very similar outfits, but the students in the background are not in uniforms.  So I may have overstated things a bit.  Still think Gloria is wealthy in a professional class kind of way.  Also, the relationship between Gloria and Weird Barbie is unclear.  Gloria says ""I had a Weird Barbie! It happens when you play too much with them!"" and Weird Barbie says ""It's okay"" and kind of winks.  I took it to mean this was Gloria's Weird Barbie, but it is ambiguous."	/r/movies/comments/1ad3ooh/hot_take_i_think_barbie_is_intentionally_a/	https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1ad3ooh/hot_take_i_think_barbie_is_intentionally_a/
barbie	movies	1abl3mo	1706283388	Second film in a double feature needed: Most badass female lead in a movie to watch after Barbie?	"Son and I are finally going to get around to watching Barbie tonight. He’s a teen so sort of outside the overt marketing demographics. Note this has nothing to do with the movie itself; we’re both extremely spoiler-averse so don’t know the first thing about it. All we have to go on is the general colour scheme and base product’s target audience.   
&amp;nbsp;  

That said, it’s a weekend so we’ll have time to get in two movies, so I'm trying to think of what to pair with it. My assumption is that it's light-hearted fun along the lines of the Lego Movie or maybe Legally Blonde (not in plot but more in tenor). So something more action-oriented is in the cards, preferably one with a female lead who's just a female lead without any underlying patronization (er, not that Barbie has any; I have no idea. I just mean a great movie that happens to have a female lead).    
&amp;nbsp;  



I’m thinking a rewatch of Aliens. He's seen both that and Alien, but it’s been a few years and due for a rewatch. We weren’t huge fans of the Hunger Games (good books though), liked lots of Tarantino’s works but Kill Bill wasn’t our thing, tried but failed to get into the Avenger and related universe, so the Wonder Woman franchise isn't likely to be our thing, petered out on the cash-grabby Star Wars movies, Tank Girl is sort of in line but not gritty enough to balance and from what I remember, good but not great (from what I gather Barbie is supposed to be pretty awesome)  ... and so I’m coming up short thinking of a more badass character than Ripley and a better vehicle than Aliens.

But I’m super limited in my awareness — what else matches Aliens for overall greatness and badassery in an action movie that will complement the fun of watching Barbie?  


Edit: Run Lola Run would have been perfect if we hadn't seen it so recently. If you haven't, go watch it!!"	/r/movies/comments/1abl3mo/second_film_in_a_double_feature_needed_most/	https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1abl3mo/second_film_in_a_double_feature_needed_most/
barbie	TrueFilm	19dspi4	1706028245	Barbie and the Oscars	"So, Oscar nominations were announced this morning. As usual, the online kerfuffle belies the pretty standard results (were there any nominations that truly surprised anyone? Not for me), but the curious thing I've seen crop up time and time again are *Barbie* fans angry that the film didn't get even more nominations.

This tweet from Shannon Watts was what sparked this post initially:  


&gt;*Greta Gerwig: Made a critically acclaimed, culturally profound, feminist movie about Barbie and the patriarchy that made a billion dollars at the box office.*     
&gt;  
&gt;*Oscar nomination goes to … Ken.* 

To be clear, *Barbie* was nominated **8 Oscars**, including Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Supporting Actor, Best Supporting Actress, and Best Picture. Ryan Gosling beat out much more deserving actors (alas, Charlie Melton; we knew him well), the film's screenplay, co-written by Gerwig, beat out *Killers of the Flower Moon* (which is wild to me) and the only big areas where it missed -- Best Actress and Best Director -- are unusually stacked this year. 

I quite enjoyed *Barbie*, and I understand that many hold it in higher regard than I do, but I don't agree that Margot Robbie should have been nominated over Lily Gladstone, Emma Stone, or Sandra Hüller. I don't agree that Greta Gerwig should have been nominated over Christopher Nolan, Scorsese, Justine Triet, or Yorgos Lanthimos.

And look, disagreements about who was/wasn't nominated is as old as the Oscars itself. Additionally, it's not uncommon for the Academy to snub women in these quote unquote ""higher tier"" categories (as a filmmaker myself, I decry the idea that ""Best Actor"" is a more worthy award than Costume &amp; Hairstyling or Production Design, but that's another conversation). I also am aware that many *adore* this film (just see [my last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/189hp07/to_many_barbie_was_just_a_good_film_and_thats_okay/) about *Barbie*). Again, I enjoyed it myself, and I don't want to disabuse folks of the films they like.

At the same time, I can't help but look at those 8 Oscar nominations for a film that beat out, arguably, much more compelling contenders on the back of its financial and social success and think ""*Seriously? 8 Oscar nominations isn't enough?*"" It's a similar ""all or nothing"" mentality I see often among MCU fans when award season comes around. In fact, you can that mentality brewing in the Animation category as *The Boy and the Heron* and *Across the Spider-Verse* battle it out.

On the one hand, I'm sensitive to the fact that women are often shafted during award season, particularly female directors, and I understand why not seeing Greta Gerwig, in particular, among the nominees can be frustrating. On the other hand, I can't help but feel like this is the literal best case scenario for *Barbie* \-- a film that won the pop culture war five times over, earned a literal billion dollars at the box office, which secured Greta Gerwig's and Margot Robbie's filmmaking futures in perpetuity, and then went on to get more Oscar nominations than most films ever get, all in spite of some pretty obvious flaws and in a year that was unusually competitive.

8 Oscars is more than *May December* got. It's more than *Anatomy of a Fall* got. It's more than *The Holdovers* got.

My point is not that *Barbie* is a bad film (it isn't) or that it's not deserving of some award-season love (it is), but rather that the conversation around this film is so unusually antagonistic that, even when it succeeds beyond anyone's wildest dreams -- likely including Gerwig and Robbie's -- it *still* isn't enough."	/r/TrueFilm/comments/19dspi4/barbie_and_the_oscars/	https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/19dspi4/barbie_and_the_oscars/
barbie	movies	19cvhfy	1705929664	Barbie IS an adapted screenplay	"For those who don’t have small kids at home, there are currently NINE Barbie cartoon TV shows or movies on Netflix. The one my kids like, “Barbie: Life in the Dreamhouse” originally aired from 2012-2015 features the following:

- characters being self aware that they are dolls

- Ken being needy for Barbie’s attention

- references to Barbies many careers 

This AV Club article has a good summary https://www.avclub.com/barbie-life-in-the-dreamhouse-meta-commentary-1850649407

Greta Gerwig’s Barbie relies not only on existing characters but also existing characterizations and portrayals.

barbie	TrueFilm	1946id3	1704992499	It is understandable why Barbie (2023) was misunderstood	"There is a lot of online discussion about the comments made by Jo Koy. The comments were disrespectful and misogynistic. I see a lot of responses to that online stating that ""men like him are why Barbie was made"". Even before his comments, there were discussion about interpreting Barbie. But, to an extent, I feel that Barbie deserved that misunderstanding.

Barbie has a wonderful cast and an excellent team of technicians. Apart from the questions about its theme, it felt complete as a movie. I watched the movie in the cinemas after it had grossed around $1 billion worldwide. But I was left confused at the end of the movie and I assumed it was because of me. So I gave it time and read some reviews and analysis of the movie online. After reading several of those, I felt that people generally took from the movie what they wanted to take from it.

Different people understood different things from Barbie. Some of the themes that people understood from the movie were: (1) women struggling with a high beauty standard, (2) how bad patriarchy can be (but this was shown by creating a matriarchy in the Barbie world), (3) how patriarchy in the real world leads to toxic masculinity, (4) journey of self-discovery undertaken by both Barbie and Ken, (5) criticism of capitalism.  
But the problem for me is that all these themes can't go together. If you wanted to show patriarchy as a problem by switching roles, you should not show Barbies as righteous. If you want the audience to sympathize with people representing (and actively wanting) a flawed system, then the rest of it doesn't simply fly. The whole ""literally impossible to be a woman"" speech seems out of place then. What exactly does each character want? What is the meaning of Barbie advising Ken to find his self-esteem while maintaining the Barbieland in its old self?

Margot Robbie's Barbie struggles through an identity crisis because she feels she is not pretty. The narrator says at this point, ""Margot Robbie is the wrong person to cast if you want to make this point"". Isn't that just another beauty standard?

Barbie is not a criticism of capitalism or the harmful effects of Barbie on young girls. If it was, Mattel would not have let it happen. They profited from it.

The only point I could make out of all of this discussion was that the entire movie, at every turn, was just a big satire. But if nobody felt it was a satire, then the movie has failed at that too. A lot of support for Barbie because it was seemingly in support of women and was directed by Greta Gerwig. Gerwig's previous movies are considered to be solid works. If Adam Sandler had directed this movie, I don't think anyone would have bothered to say it was good. A lot of mainstream criticism that this movie got was from the conservative circle. If the movie was directed by a conservative or someone who had previously made misogynistic comments or movies, then the opinions would have switched.

Nobody can blame Jo Koy or anyone for not understanding the movie. If you need to write blog posts and make 30-minute YouTube videos to explain the themes of a movie in detail, then that movie may have failed in its primary objective. Barbie is not the first movie to face this problem. A lot of movies end up not being clear in their message, but the burden of understanding a movie has not fallen upon the audience as hard as Barbie's has.

Please share your opinions. Correct me if I missed something."	/r/TrueFilm/comments/1946id3/it_is_understandable_why_barbie_2023_was/	https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/1946id3/it_is_understandable_why_barbie_2023_was/

barbie	movies	18x92uw	1704252142	My thoughts on Barbie	"I’ll start by saying the aesthetics and acting are the best parts. The dialogue is also pretty good but the story is where I have the biggest issue next to the pacing. I really enjoyed the commentary and self awareness (which also worked against the movie at times because there are instances where it insists upon itself) but the actual story is clunky and disjointed, which makes the movie drag on. 

While Barbie has some good character traits like vulnerability, she’s not the most likable character, there’s a bit of a cold rudeness to her. We see her flaws but there’s really not enough to root for her in my opinion. 

Overall I’d give it a 6.5-7, it could have trimmed the fat and been less self-indulgent. I’m not trying to hate bash it, I was just disappointed and wished I would have enjoyed it more."	/r/movies/comments/18x92uw/my_thoughts_on_barbie/	https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/18x92uw/my_thoughts_on_barbie/
barbie	TrueFilm	18wiyof	1704177801	Ending of Barbie inspired by Vanilla Sky?	"I saw Barbie recently and noticed the ending very similar to Vanilla Sky, especially with her making the choice of deciding to go to the real world, and shows a montage. 

It’s a very similar scene to the end of Vanilla sky where David ends up seeing a montage of life before waking up in the real world.

Does anybody know if this was a direct inspiration, or just a common film trope?"	/r/TrueFilm/comments/18wiyof/ending_of_barbie_inspired_by_vanilla_sky/	https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/18wiyof/ending_of_barbie_inspired_by_vanilla_sky/
barbie	movies	18w1i9z	1704129924	Personal challenge complete: A movie a day in 2023	"My wife and I decided last year to watch at least one movie a day in 2023, and we met our goal last night with 380 complete films, 631 total hours. We had some rules for counting: the movie had to be something at least one of us hadn't seen, or was one we hadn't seen in two-or-more years. Additionally, we have some small kids at home, and if they wanted to have a movie night with us AND the movie fit our criteria, then it got counted (which is why there's some... questionable quality content involving children things).

We made two exceptions during the year -- one day we decided to mix it up and watch several short films instead of a feature length movie, and on Christmas Eve we watched A Christmas Story, which we have both seen often but is a yearly tradition.

I know these are rookie numbers for some, but it was a pretty fun challenge. 

The full list is below, but here is my top 3 of each month, in viewing order. (Note: I'm not saying these are critically the best movies, just the ones that stuck with me):

July - Fargo (1996); The Rules of the Game (1939); Targets (1968)

August - Jacob's Ladder (1990); Aftersun (2022); Upstream Color (2013)

barbie	flicks	18vdaem	1704045780	A Very Long, Detailed Ranking of (Almost) Every Movie I Watched in 2023	"29. Extraction 2 - God, what a waste of time. Hardly any character was compelling, the movie scared with its visual blandness, action itself underwhelmed. One of the characters’ death scene was so overdone I laughed. Now, mind you, I almost NEVER laugh at death in movies, so that should give you an example of how mediocre this shit was.   
28. Pan Samochodzik i Templariusze/Mr. Car and the Knights Templar - this is the first non-American movie and the first Polish one. Brace yourselves, you’re going to see quite a few of these. In short, the movie is fairly insulting to the original books, does nothing with the semi-interesting reinterpretation of the character, provides some very clunky characterization and semi-decent action. I’d say its most redeeming quality is the fact that its nonsensical execution made for hilarious comedy sometimes.  
27. Knights of the Zodiac - this finally had proper visuals, but the plot was more confusing. The inciting incident itself doesn’t make sense! Why does Athena, the goddess of wisdom and “just” war possess a random girl and intend to destroy the world? Well, you will never know because fuck the audience. It’s amazing how lacking almost everything is and how utterly formulaic the movie is at times. Didn’t help that the bigger caliber actors were wasted.  
26. Akademia Pana Kleksa/Kleks Academy - the first non-American movie. A valiant if lacking effort to revive the world and characters of a classic Polish book for children. Overall, I’d say this is something between a remake, a reboot, a sequel and a prequel to the original book. So we already have a mess. The pacing is very uneven, the acting kind of works, the scenery and visuals kind of slay occasionally, overall the technical execution does a lot of heavy lifting. But the heavy-handed themes (even if praiseworthy in concept) and very clunky dialogue combined with questionable editing brings this down quite a bit.  
25. The Marvels - another very confused movie that wastes most of its prominent characters. I feel very sorry for Brie Larson and Zawe Ashton, they deserved a better movie. A longer, darker one. I would also feel sorry for Iman Vellani, but she slayed and her character, Kamala Khan, was actually written engagingly and consistently. The visuals provide some nice views from time to time, there is overall creativity and a vision to all this, but it all feels too disjointed, rushed, undercooked. The result is a film with some heart, comedic beats and spectacle that will somewhat keep your attention. But nothing more.  
24. Creed III - Maybe it was my mistake to go for this without watching the two previous movies, but I digress. The movie is overall well executed, has some nice tension, I like Donnie and Dame as characters, but I just… don’t have a whole lot to say about it. It’s a nicely done, inoffensive, a little bland, but fine movie.  
23. You People - contrary to almost everyone around, I like this movie. I found Ezra and Amara’s relationship believable, Julia Louis Dreyfus and Eddie Murphy did well as the oppositely annoying parents to each of the protagonists, the humor had me laughing heartily at times and the movie even drops some truth bombs at times.  
22. Mafia Mamma - a surprisingly well-realized fish-out-of-water comedy. Toni Collette fit the main character like a glove, she works amazing as this super driven yet frantic woman who was pulled into murky mafia shit. The supporting characters and antagonists are likeable, interesting and well motivated. The movie doesn’t do much blunders, it’s not really great but it works fine for what it sets out to achieve.  
21. R.M.N./Electromagnetic Resonance - this time we dip our fingers in Eastern Europe, Romania specifically. The acclaimed director Cristian Mungiu sets forth a very atmospheric and engrossing piece of political/social commentary that succeeds for the most part. Most, because the protagonist is almost completely disconnected from the drama of two Asian immigrants trying to work and acclimate to a remote Romanian village. The movie sometimes lost its focus, but when it had it, it worked wonders in its uncompromising desire to examine modern Romanian society.  
20. Kryptonim Polska/Codename Poland - the penultimate motion picture from my homeland in this ranking. Gotta say, I did not expect this movie to be as good as it was. It’s a pretty straightforward if insanely biting piece of political satire. Shit had me HOLLERING with laughter at how well it ridiculed the stupid crap we Poles pull these days. The characters were well realized, and I especially appreciate the antagonists effortlessly switching between comedic mooks to actual intimidating nationalists. The movie overall succeeds in broad tone shifts.   
19. Beau Is Afraid - while I believe Ari Aster had every right to put everything he did in the movie, sometimes he just overdid it. The craziness was well-presented, but sometimes the film just behaved insane for the sake of it. A balls-tripping adventure is very cool but can sometimes get nauseating and overdone. Still, the movie engrossed me with its striking aesthetics, delightfully unhinged characters and some deep themes. I just wish he didn’t turn &gt;!Mona, Beau’s mom and!&lt; the movie’s main antagonist, into a mouthpiece that spelled everything out in a damn monologue. The ending, however? Shit was right up my alley. It was subtle enough to not look on the nose but explicit enough to be immediately understandable. It felt grim, but was also a supremely fitting conclusion to the movie and Beau himself.  
17. The Flash - this movie somehow manages to be more insane than BIA. And yet it overall is somewhat better. I was initially harsh on the score, but it grew on me with time and I can safely say Benjamin Wallfisch did a good job. The acting slays, Ezra Miller, his behavior notwithstanding, is Barry Allen to me, maybe as much as Grant Gustin. EM portrayed both Barry 1 and 2 perfectly, Ben Affleck put in a very good if brief performance as DCEU Batman, everyone else did fine as well. Barry 2 is a fantastic character that you root for, get annoyed by and feel sorry for, experiencing believable growth and development in a super engaging way. The effects somewhat suck balls, but the overall cinematography and direction make up for it. However, the movie FLOUNDERS hard in the 3rd act and it's due to it that I cannot call the Flash anything more than good.  
16. The Killer - a very well paced and elegantly executed thriller from David Fincher. Fun cinematography, another compelling performance from Fassbender. Also liked the themes of the movie and the protagonist’s arc. Overall, a movie with somewhat high highs and kinda low lows.   
15. John Wick: Chapter 4 - as emotionally flat as this movie is, I really like it. The visuals are insane for a simple hitman movie, the action, even if self-indulgent, is overall top notch, the actors give it their all and the pacing maintains a steady flow that makes for an enjoyable watching experience. Maybe if the screenplay was more thematically and emotionally loaded I’d crank it up a bit…  
14. Luther: The Fallen Sun - surprised me, because certain parts of the beginning jarred me. However, the movie soon turned into a high-octane but restrained and somewhat grounded thriller that plays with some timely themes. All Andy Serkis, Idris Elba and Cynthia Erivo give great performances, with the shoutout to the latter, she did great in the 3rd act especially. Lorne Balfe goes INSANE with a score that manages to be inspiring, tense, menacing and soulful. Shit is crazy underrated. The action in this movie was also very well executed.  
13. Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny - the first great movie on the list. Somehow, bringing back the familiar elements from the previous Indy films did not feel jarring, but rather in-place. I felt Helena was rather charismatic and properly developed as a character, the spin Mangold put here on the Nazis provides a very fresh angle that I really enjoyed, the action doesn’t lose the old Spielbergian energy and liveliness and the last 10 minutes are just beautiful. The conclusion to Indiana Jones and Harrison Ford’s tenure in the role touched me deeply. I personally believe this is the best conclusion an old Indy could have gotten.  
12. The Pale Blue Eye - This rather slow burn of a movie stuns with fascinating shots of a wintery New York and some rather immaculate acting. The final payoff with Bale’s character, August Landor, makes for a supremely rewarding ending, if incredibly dark. I also enjoyed Harry Melling’s portrayal of Edgar Allan Poe and the semi-psychedelic vibe maintained throughout the plot.  
11. El Puño del Cóndor/The Fist of the Condor - a surprisingly well-made Chilean martial arts film. Marko Zaror shines as the actor playing the lead and the antagonist, as well as the combat choreographer behind the fight scenes. Ernesto Espinoza, the writer-director of the film, presents an atmospheric and energetic 80 minute flick which combines high-octane Latino martial arts with spiritual themes, leading to a resolution with the Hoist By His Own Petard trope. While a fine trope in of itself, it is cranked up to awesome levels by the INSANE execution of it as writing, juxtaposition and cinematography combine to create a moment of pure filmmaking magic. Definite recommendation!  
10. The In-Laws/Teściowie - the final Polish film on the list. I expected a semi-serious comedy in a confined setting, what I got was an absurdly captivating escalation drama. Accompanied, I should add, by inspired performances from the 4 lead actors, incredibly atmospheric cinematography and a string of mysteries and reveals that kept me engaged and thrilled. Very strong writing, especially with the ending twist.  
9. Maestro - this is the highest ranked movie I have mixed feelings about. Sometimes, it lacks focus, is incredibly on-the-nose and kinda beats about the bush. But most of the time it gives a compelling insight into the relationship of Leonard Bernstein and Felicia Montealegre. Cooper and Mulligan both shine as the leads, and their performances improve as their characters age. The displays of Bernstein’s musical skills, as sparse as they were, felt incredibly telling and impactful. The camera went CRAZY, Matthew Libatique deserves an Oscar nom for the almost painting-like visual look he crafted with Cooper for the movie. And Bernstein’s music befitted the overall pic utterly. This is a case of very high highs outmatching low lows.  
8. Napoleon - screw the critics, this movie won me over. I was kind of waiting for it, hoping Ridley Scott would be unapologetic in his portrayal of the emperor. And he was. Napoleon was portrayed as such a vainglorious shitheel, I could not believe my eyes. I was utterly giddy at how the movie effortlessly switched between satire and drama while still remembering to get me to care for the two leads. Great performances by Phoenix and Kirby. FANTASTIC direction and photography for the battles of Toulon and Austerlitz. Impressive score by Martin Phipps. Wow!  
7. BlackBerry - a movie about phones and the communication market, boring? You’d think so, but this one is actually sort of a tour de force. Stylized with retro aesthetics, brimming with unmistakable energy and personality, BlackBerry takes us on a captivating journey of the titular phone and the people who made it, their rise and their fall. Glenn Howerton and Jay Baruchel shine as the two leads, Jim Balsille and Mike Lazaridis, whose relationship reminded me of RDJ and Cillian Murphy as Lewis Strauss and Julius Robert Oppenheimer. Except this is kind of a different spin, and here, one of the protagonists becomes like the other over time, instead of becoming their opposite. It’s very engaging to watch. But the highest praise is reserved for Matt Johnson, director, screenwriter and main supporting actor of the film, who realized a tense yet comedic experience that brilliantly showcases the chaotic and unforgiving landscape of big business.  
6. Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes - I had moderate expectations for this one, and shit man, it surpassed them with flying colors! Strong performances all around, with special shoutouts to the two leads playing characters that can’t be easily put into boxes and the gloriously hammy Viola Davis. The movie shines through its atmosphere that sucks you in and themes which infuse the conflict with meaning and make you care about the characters’ fate. Overall, a success on almost all fronts.  
5. Pamfir - No Country For Old Men in Ukraine. However, let me be bold and say this is supremely better than the disappointing NCFOM. While it mirrors the Coens’ movie in showcasing the dissatisfaction and futility of life, it doesn’t spit in my face for being invested in the main characters. The leads are also very human and likeable, and the lack of music somehow works. But Pamfir’s biggest strength is its goddamn visual panache. It’s shot in a very believable and naturalistic yet riveting manner. It makes excellent use of natural scenery and light, showcasing the beauty of Ukraine and coming off as stylized enough to provide a greatly immersive experience.  
4. Barbie - a simple, but very thematically interesting and entertaining exercise in social satire. Love its use of montages and visual storytelling, love the themes behind the movie and the performances of the actors. Ken is a goddamn outstanding character, and Ryan Gosling 100% deserves his Oscar nom. The music is also wicked good when it comes to it, and the movie overall gave me a fun and creative experience that also made me think of certain things.  
3. Oppenheimer - Christopher Nolan just don’t miss, man. He don’t miss at all. Oppenheimer is a fascinating, staggering watch that combines multiple time periods with grace and panache, weaving them together into a compelling character study. Murphy’s Oppenheimer and RDJ’s Strauss are some of the best characters of the decade, and I was more than enthralled by their methodical, gradual evolution over time. Ludwig Goransson puts forward masterful soundtrack pieces as if it was just another Thursday for him, Hoyte Van Hoytema stuns with detailed and crisp yet stylized cinematography, and Jennifer Lame keeps the movie’s pace and energy intact in the editing. This movie is exactly the biopic we need and deserve. The piece de resistance of 2023 cinema.  
2. Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 - James Gunn’s magnum opus. It was moving, hilarious, tense, fun and grandiose. Despite the plot being fairly straightforward, this movie is anything but simple, as it carefully concludes the development of several recurring characters and brings us a fantastic villain in the flesh of the High Evolutionary. John Murphy proves a worthy replacement for Tyler Bates as the main composer, Henry Braham creates visuals that wow despite the muted colors and I don’t even have to say anything about the outstanding practical effects/makeup/prosthetics work, do I? Also, Rocket Raccoon, who is undoubtedly one of the best and most fleshed out characters in the MCU.  
1. Babylon - what an unbelievably outstanding piece of CINEMA. Jesus. Not only does it have three fully developed leads that I all cared for and rooted for, a supporting cast that can both amuse and move you but also a visual layer that is a goddamn moving painting. With just this movie, Linus Sandgren rose above almost any Hollywood cinematographer. The acting is fantastic, the narrative is thrilling and keeps you interested in further developments, the movie switches flawlessly between comedy, tension and emotion. It even has a bloody chase scene that is in fact one of the best in my memory. It is a damning critique of cinema as an industry and a love letter to it as an art form. All brought together by Damien Chazelle’s expert direction and Justin Hurwitz’s masterful soundtrack. MASTERPIECE!

I apologize if this has been asked before but 2023 is coming to an end and I believe this year was absolutely incredible for the cinema. The decline of Disney, MCU, and DECU provided opened the door to blockbusters like *Barbie* and *Oppenheimer* which hyped up the summer box office. It was also an incredible year for the range of directors that made films: Scorsese, Mann, Fincher, Anderson, Nolan, Gerwig, Lanthimos, Scott, Payne, etc. . .  Animated films continued to depart from tradition 3D animation to the *Spider-Verse* style with films like TMNT.  The top 3 highest-grossing films of the year were all originals,  the last year in which that occurred was 2001.   My personal thoughts are that 2023 has the possibility to be compared to 2019. Not 2007 or 1999 territory but could be considered one of the best of the decade.	/r/movies/comments/18rt34b/how_will_we_look_back_at_2023_as_a_year_in_film/	https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/18rt34b/how_will_we_look_back_at_2023_as_a_year_in_film/
barbie	movies	18fe5ia	1702244403	The rudimentary feminism of Barbie	"As award season discussion ramps up, I've seen more and more the idea that the feminist theory on display in Barbie is too simplistic or dumbed-down. Rather than disagree with this viewpoint, I think that Greta Gerwig made a very deliberate decision to pitch the film at an introductory level.

This is a movie that little girls are going to want to watch for a long time. I'm sure most people seeing Barbie in theaters earlier this year would have noticed the girls in attendance. For thousands and thousands of girls (and boys) it will be a first introduction to feminist principles, which is why a primer is a more valuable choice than bleeding edge current theory. It is a jumping off point for an ongoing journey, not an endpoint. In 30 years time I'm confident that this movie will be beloved by a new generation that have grown up with it, holding a similar place of affection that a movie like, say, A League of Their Own does now. It is to be applauded that Gerwig has made a movie that I think both works today, and will grow in stature with time.

(Incidentally, this is also the reason I think the America Ferrera monologue was the correct choice. While it is somewhat heavy handed for an adult audience, for younger ears being explicit with your meaning isn't a bad idea. Gerwig knew making a movie with the Barbie IP was a rare opportunity to make an unprecedented feminist Trojan horse, and she swung for the fences.)"	/r/movies/comments/18fe5ia/the_rudimentary_feminism_of_barbie/	https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/18fe5ia/the_rudimentary_feminism_of_barbie/

barbie	TrueFilm	189hp07	1701564837	"To many, Barbie was just a ""good"" film, and that's okay"	"I saw a tweet from Richard Brody today that said the following:

&gt;*Dismayed and (not entirely) shocked by the low place / no place of Barbie in so many best-of lists; the familiar mistake that serious movies must have a serious mien. Only ""high"" (i.e., ""elevated"") comedy passes through the sieve.*

I've heard similar thoughts from friends of mine. One asked me what some of my favorites of the year were, and after I'd listed off a few she said, ""*Barbie should be at the top*.""

Now, setting aside the fact that I think it's insane people are putting out ""best of"" lists in the first week of December (how're you gonna put out a best of list before you see *The Boy and the Heron* or *Poor Things*?), I find myself at odds with this line of thinking -- mainly that people are not giving *Barbie* its due, either, as Brody claims, because it's ""not serious or elevated enough"" or, as my friend would put it, ""because, as a man, I don't *truly* get it.""

To be clear, I quite enjoyed *Barbie*. I've seen about 70 movies this year so far, and it's sitting pretty at #15 right now. But it's not going to be in my top 10 whenever I get around to making that list in January. Hell, by that point, it might not be in the top 20. And that's not because it's a bad film, or even a mediocre film, but because it is a good film in a year when we've had a bunch of masterpieces released.

Personally, I don't see think *Barbie* is better than *Killers of the Flower Moon, May December, Past Lives, The Holdovers, Anatomy of a Fall,* or *Rye Lane*, all of which were incredible, creative, and unique. It can both be true that I thought *Barbie* was good, but not so good that it deserves a spot above any of the aforementioned films.

This also ties into another trend I've seen surrounding *Barbie*, one which a YouTuber I enjoy, Broey Deschanel, [explained in great depth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2vE-hFCpLc): mainly that while *Barbie* was good it shouldn't be exempt from discussions about its flaws, which *do* exist, whether we're talking about the rushed characterizations and familial work between Gloria and Sasha, or about how, as much as the film explicitly explores feminist and progressive themes, it largely does so through a ""white feminist"" lens and ultimately fails to effectively critique corporate power or Mattel beyond a few Will Ferrell one-liners.

To be clear, it's totally valid to critique the film on these points and still put it high on your ""best of"" list. It's *your* list. I'm not here to disabuse folks of their taste or preference. Hell, *Evil Dead Rise* was one of my favorites this year, not because it's a paragon of the cinematic form or without flaws, but simply because it was an *Evil Dead* movie that checked every box for me. 

Similarly, while I think *Killers of the Flower Moon* was a masterpiece and one of Scorsese's best, it should not be shielded from criticism -- especially from the Osage community, as this is *their* story. And hey, if 3-and-a-half hour historical epics aren't your cup of tea, then I don't blame you for ranking it lower.

But I also haven't seen this argument or perspective levied to defend any other movie released this year. If I can compare this to anything, it's how die-hard MCU fans defend the latest Marvel project and slap away all criticism, whether that criticism is the product of trolls or an honest attempt to reckon with the film at hand.

To tie these threads together, I think this line of thinking -- that anyone who doesn't love *Barbie,* place it at the top of their ""best of"" list, and sing its praises, is blind to its charms, unable to engage with the thematic substance, and/or elitist in their tastes -- does more of a detriment to the film than encouraging discussion about its flaws would. It can simply be true that a lot of people liked *Barbie* but didn't love it, or that they loved it, but not as much as some of the other movies they saw this year.

Cinema is not a binary; rarely is a film entirely good or entirely bad. They exist on a spectrum, flaws mixing with mastery. That's what makes them art. As our film discourse careens toward these sorts of shallow and simplified conversations, I fear we'll lose our ability to engage with the art where it is at, and we will lose the ability to effectively and coherently discuss our likes and dislikes with each other.

Place *Barbie* wherever you feel it best fits on your list. Defend its placement there, of course. But I don't think it's fair or accurate to judge someone's taste or cinematic blind-spots solely on that placement."	/r/TrueFilm/comments/189hp07/to_many_barbie_was_just_a_good_film_and_thats_okay/	https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/189hp07/to_many_barbie_was_just_a_good_film_and_thats_okay/
barbie	movies	183syvk	1700944811	In hindsight, Barbie seems highly overrated to me	"I am squarely in the film's target demographic. Don't get me wrong - it's an enjoyable and lovingly realized film. Margot Robbie's performance alone makes it well worth seeing.

But upon rewatch, the words that come to mind are - insubstantial, muddled, and meandering. Ken was hilarious but the amount of time devoted to him was excessive in my opinion.

Kudos to WB for the most aggressive marketing long game I have ever seen

barbie	movies	182qu7s	1700828164	The Greta Gerwig-Noah Baumbach Film Utopia	"There has never been a film partnership between auteurs like Noah Baumbach and Greta Gerwig have formed. (They are also life partners, with two children.)

Their partnership is unique in their individual and combined successes. Baumbach was first nominated for an Academy Award in 2005 for The Squid and the Whale, and again for Marriage Story in 2019. 

Baumbach presents themes of aloneness and failed relationships. Perhaps the most stark example was his 2007 film, Margot at the Wedding, about two alienated sisters.

He met Gerwig when she acted in his 2010 film, Greenberg. She also acted in the 2022 Baumbach-directed White Noise. He and Gerwig have collaborated as auteurs on three films. 

They co-wrote Frances Ha (2012) and Mistress America (2015), dark comedies in which Gerwig starred. Baumbach directed both films. In each Gerwig played a woman with a good heart but who is insensitive. Other characters also aren’t cruel but are often obtuse. 

Gerwig began her commercial directorial career (she directed a low-budget 2008 film, Nights and Weekends) with Lady Bird (2017) and Little Women (2019). In both, young women overcome challenges within a family to achieve success. Both earned best picture Academy Award nominations and individual nominations for Gerwig, including best director for the former. 

In 2023 Baumbach and Gerwig collaborated as writers on Barbie, which Gerwig directed. It was a monumental hit, earning over $1 billion worldwide. Gerwig remains remarkably even-keeled and modest, however.

The three commercial films that Gerwig has directed have a different mood from the two she co-wrote with Baumbach and starred in. As in virtually all of Baumbach’s films, Gerwig’s main character played out a depressed life scenario. Both films are centered in New York. In both her characters’ grand ambitions are thwarted and she splits with her main female friend. In the end, in both films, she finds more limited professional engagement and makes a promising connection with someone.

Her own three directorial efforts, on the other hand (none of which she acts in), are set in non-urban, idyllic settings (Barbie’s setting, of course, is a fantasy world).

What do their directorial efforts say about their differing world views (at least as represented in film)?  Baumbach’s films are pessimistic about intimate relationships and present interpersonal strife as inevitable.  Career success, too, is illusory. His films express alienation.

Gerwig’s films display a more optimistic, even idealistic, view of life. Set in middle-America, they are open to the American dream of success (which she and Baumbach have in fact achieved in spades). 

Barbie represents a compromise between these two visions of life. In it, challenges in relationships and gender conflict are resolved magically in a fantasy realm. Is this realm the utopia that Gerwig and Baumbach have formed together?"	/r/movies/comments/182qu7s/the_greta_gerwignoah_baumbach_film_utopia/	https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/182qu7s/the_greta_gerwignoah_baumbach_film_utopia/

barbie	TrueFilm	17utwae	1699934850	Ken is the one thing the Barbie movie got right	"A lot of people have named Ryan Gosling’s Ken as the MVP of Greta Gerwig’s “Barbie”. (I agree, yet kudos to the wonderful Margot Robbie for slaying as always!) Besides Gosling’s impeccable comedic timing, though, my impression on a rewatch is that Ken is by far the best-written character in the movie, and ultimately consistent in a way that Barbie herself is not. I’ll make my case.

The idea of getting Barbie and Ken into the real world, “Enchanted”-style, while not original on its own, is milked for some amusing and entertaining jokes. But when Barbie arrives in California, besides a brief scene in a bus stop and then in a school, she’s seen venturing into the Mattel headquarters, in a building ruled by a group of silly, stereotypical male executives. This is a side plot that exists purely for satirical purposes – so much so that, at some point, the movie conveniently forgets about these characters and puts them aside; even when they come back during the climax, it's clear they have no real role to play in the resolution.

As a result, most of Barbie’s time in the “real world” is spent in a place as ludicrous, absurd, and cartoonish as her native Barbieland: there’s not much of a difference (from her perspective, at least) between the fantasy dimension she just left behind and the new environment she finds herself in while at Mattel’s. The movie barely shows Barbie experiencing the real world – and since the character’s arc leads her into a gradual fascination with the human existence, that’s a considerable gap in development when she makes a life-changing decision near the end. We were never sure of her personal quest up until that point. From a script structure, Barbie’s arc goes somewhat like this…

**What Barbie wants:** to shut down those intrusive existential questions that suddenly plagued her and shattered the perfect sheltered reality of her beloved Barbieland.

**What Barbie really needs:** to understand those complex thoughts as part of being human and experiencing the pains and joys of life.

**How Barbie gets from point A to B:** by sitting on a bench for a minute next to a fierce old lady, and then being roasted by America Ferrera’s daughter, apparently…? The movie juggles so many themes at once that the protagonist’s story gets buried between the lines.

And then there’s Ken... Ken, unlike Barbie, indeed gets a taste of reality during his short stay in California. After comically misunderstanding the concept of patriarchy, we see him going out to look for a job – as a man, he assumes all doors would open for him, after all. Then he’s turned down by a doctor, a lifeguard and every other professional he seeks; they explain to him that any profession requires some level of practice and dedication. Uninterested in doing the hard work, Ken returns to Barbieland, where experience is not a requirement to have a high-profile job.

*\[In retrospect, I wondered this would be a TERRIFIC arc for Barbie, since in Barbieland, the other doll variations had many different professions, while her, as stereotypical Barbie, was never granted one. It’s great to inspire girls around to world to play astronauts, but it could be an even more powerful message to portray someone realizing what their dream was and pursuing it. Yet that was clearly not the movie the filmmakers wanted to make, so let’s leave it at that.\]*

Back to the point! So, Ken’s arc goes somewhat like this…

**What Ken wants:** to assert his masculinity as a way of being appreciated by Barbie.

**What Ken really needs:** to finally be able to let go of external expectations and put himself first.

**How Ken gets from point A to B:** by experiencing the real world, he concludes that he’s part of the dominant gender, that he’s able to have a profession like the rulers of Barbieland, and that professions are means for men to attest their masculinity as breadwinners; he returns to take control of Barbieland, hoping he will finally be respected by Barbie. He achieves societal power but remains empty inside, because he was doing it for all the wrong reasons and using all the wrong means – until Barbie makes him realize he's also able to forge his own path.

When it comes to Ken, everything – from the way he’s introduced, to the way he always behaves as his silly old self while out in the real world, to the way he remains authentically clueless while interacting with somewhat realistic characters that could exist in society – ties his arc together. Barbie, sadly, is never developed enough to be this consistent. From start to finish, she goes through the film without a clear definition (to the audience) of her level of knowledge, skill, and intellect. She gets to the real world as oblivious as Ken was, but is also portrayed as being familiar with concepts such as fascism when the screenplay sees the opportunity for a timely joke.

The “revelations” that stem from Barbie’s journey are eventually boiled down to “people age and die”, “people fight and cry”, and “women don’t have it easy”. Those insights play no role in the overall future of Barbieland, which is the mission the movie sets for her - even her empathetic dialogue with Ken benefits only ""her"" Ken, not the other Ken. Even after her breakthrough, she does nothing to promote an equalitarian society - the movie couldn't live without the joke that Barbieland will be just like the inversion of reality (men slowly making progress, but not too fast).

In the end, Barbie decides to become a human without ever considering how her lack of education will impact her prospects in the real world. (I personally got the feeling America Ferrera was raising her like a second daughter??). Barbie was touched by Ferrera’s previous speech about the hardships of womanhood, and while this speech is used to enlighten every single Barbie to reclaim their place, the movie ignores nuance and context. It's not like existing in modern day California as a Latina, Black or trans woman is the same as roaming the world as Margot Robbie. *\[IMO, the movie made the decision to include other versions of Barbie and never saw them as anything but secondary colors on its rainbow.\]*

To wrap this up (kudos to you if you stuck with me!): Ken is a consistent and well-written character that works for the movie’s purpose and organically conveys other underlying messages; Barbie is a victim of too many themes and half-baked ideas the filmmakers couldn’t let go of. That's my take, at least.

barbie	movies	17lazex	1698841736	Downsizing (2017) is a mess. This is how you fix the script and turn it into an Awesome Film.	"I won't cover why Downsizing is a mess, many other posts have. This is how you fix it and turn it into the great film it should have been.

1. Remove the social commentary from the script. Tonally shift the movie to a Black Comedy 
2. We leave the first 45min up until Damon meets Waltz largely the same, but, Damon is in a troubled marriage NOT a happy marriage, which makes his wife's decision more logical.
3. We cut the Vietnamese lady from the script completely. Damon (who retains the characterisation as a clean cut, shlubby kind of guy), meets Waltz and is enamoured by the party and crazy life style it reveals
4. Waltz takes Damon under his wing and shows him that beneath the Barbie-doll dreamland veneer of Leisureland, there is a seedy underbelly - drugs, smuggling, prostitution all sorts of fucked up shit, like the Little People being used as dildos for seedy Large People with fucked up fantasies. Things like this
5. Damon who resists at first, slowly becomes enamoured by the lifestyle and shenanigans. After an adventure in Leisureland the two have to go to the original Norway colony for smuggling reason xyz. 
6. At the original colony, shit goes down, Waltz dies as they complete the smuggling mission and Damon learns that an expensive procedure has been developed to turn people big again. 
7. Due to an act of kindness Damon gave earlier in the movie, he is offered the chance to become big again. Camera fades to black. Scene opens with party music playing and an angry/sad pathetic looking guy in an apartment complex marching towards an apartment door, in which there is a big party happening. Schlubby guy knocks on the door yelling to be quiet. Door swings open revealing Matt Damon dressed and partying like Waltz welcoming the angry pathetic guy into the party (signalling he decided to stay and take on Waltz's underground life).
8. Roll credits"	/r/movies/comments/17lazex/downsizing_2017_is_a_mess_this_is_how_you_fix_the/	https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/17lazex/downsizing_2017_is_a_mess_this_is_how_you_fix_the/
barbie	movies	17kp6j7	1698770041	There's a lot to unpack in the Barbie movie but I want to focus on Ken	"So first off, I love this movie.

It's laugh-out-loud funny (Allen screaming when Ken hits the waves), the performances are great (Barbie going plastic-mode is great physical comedy by Margot Robbie), and it's a smart movie.

I could write a post about how it's a commentary on capitalism or influencer culture, but what I really want to focus on is Ken.

If Ken were a real-life person, he would be a Nice Guy who longs for affection from a particular person. Eventually, he discovers the Red Pill (patriarchy), abandons his true nature, and suddenly, he's getting 'results'.

And as such, the other Ken's follow his lead - to the point where the beach is filled with Ken's singing the same song to their respective dates.

This is basically a reflection of how things go in these communities. A man reports success using a particular tactic, and others emulate and refine it to the point that it's almost robotic (see *negging*)*.*

This theme flourishes in other ways as well. The Ken's suddenly feel the need to display wealth and capitalism is more than happy to provide them with leather couches, Hummers, and big-screen TV's.

There's the displays of machismo - fur coats, horses, easily exploited jealousy - that culminate in the hilarious beach fight.

And then a really interesting thing happens - the Ken's rediscover themselves in the dance-off ('I'm just Ken and I'm Kenough, and I'm great at doing stuff.').

This brings the whole Nice Guy theme full circle. Ken has been masking, amplifying, and outright manufacturing personality traits in order to win over Barbie, even though she's made it clear she's not interested.

And now he's discovered how to feel complete without her, and he's finally able to accept it.

&amp;#x200B;

To me, it's a very interesting message.

A lot of guys have these same frustrations - they don't feel good enough and they end up acting in a parallel manner to the Ken's.

Ken is an emotional character, yet he rarely shows it. He obviously loves performing but instead of showing that, he pulls ridiculous stunts to impress Barbie. He would rather mold himself to what he *thinks* Barbie wants, than be who he *is*.

Smart movie, man."	/r/movies/comments/17kp6j7/theres_a_lot_to_unpack_in_the_barbie_movie_but_i/	https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/17kp6j7/theres_a_lot_to_unpack_in_the_barbie_movie_but_i/

"This used to be a red flag for me, seeing these ""ending explained"" articles pop up when I'm searching a movie's reviews. More often than not it was a red flag for ""third act problems"": a movie whose writer just couldn't quite land the plane and so left the ending so ambiguous that it took a 1000 word essay to try to decipher the ending. 

This wasn't always the case, of course: sometimes,  the article would unravel a very well-crafted, tightly-written yet more puzzle-boxey ending for the less astute viewer and everyone went home satisfied. 

But now they seem to be pumping out these articles on the reg, just for the sake of content, and for movies with endings as on-the-nose and clear-cut as Barbie.

barbie	movies	1779tr6	1697234045	Blockbuster season 2023 is over and as a 38 year old fan of cinema I'm more surprised than anyone that Super Mario Bros was probably the best movie of the summer. My list:	"For some reference - I've gone from being the kind of guy who went to the movies 3+ times a week and loved anything in the Criterion Collection to the kind of guy who only goes to see dumb comic book movies or anything that will look good on a big screen, i.e. I've become everything that's wrong with the cinema industry today. Here's my movie ratings for Summer 2023:

* Guardians 3 - 7/10 (would've been a 6 but I love those characters, even though they overstayed their welcome)

* Super Mario - 8/10 (lifelong Nintendo fanboy who, at 38, didn't realise how much I wanted Nintendo movies) 

* John Wick 4 - 5/10 (more of the same, should've stopped at 3)

* Fast X - 6/10 (as a comedy this was a 7/10. Not a fan of these 2-parter movies tho)

* The Flash - 6/10 (didn't hate this but can't stand that Flash guy and the VFX company must have super underbid)

* Transformers 7 - 4/10 (saw this at 11am on a Friday; went to lunch around the 65 minute mark)

* Indy 5 - 6/10 (this was enjoyable but ultimately forgettable; never thought I'd appreciate Crystal Skull so much)

* Spider-Verse 2 - 6/10 (this was almost as good as the first and would've been a 7 or even 8 if they hadn't broken it into 2 parts. Learn to tell a singular story, guys)

* M:I 7 - 6/10 (same problem as Spider-Verse, but with even less of the charm. They built a whole 2+hr movie around that bike jump stunt that they already showed us in trailers for 5 months. Needlessly fluffy story, who needs rewrites when the studio wants a 2-parter?!)

* Oppenheimer - 7/10 (this was a truly great in-cinema experience; the kind of thing that reminds you why you still go to the movies. However, focusing on the political aftermath rather than the nuts and bolts of the process and history made me less likely to ever rewatch this. If it had been 40 minutes shorter I'd have given it an 8).

* Barbie - 7/10 (I'll probably never watch this again but I remember being totally entertained and bought into the universe the whole time, even despite its messy messaging)

* The Creator - 8/10 (trust Gareth Edwards to bring a mid-2010s DeviantArt digital painting to life. Love his vision and would like to see more from him, just let someone else write it next time; felt like he tried to drag out a short story into 2+hrs and the pacing went haywire in the last 25)

I think the most obvious trend with summer 2023's blockbusters are that only one on this entire list (The Creator) wasn't adapted from an original property. I think the box office numbers are showing how for the most part we're all just over franchises and sequels and are dying to see something new; I know I am. I also know we'll still get a Pokemon movie and a Spider-Verse Pt 2 and Mattel are clearly going to turn everything from Hot Wheels to freaking Uno into a movie 🤷🏻‍♂️ Personally I can't wait for Todd Phillips' gritty take on the origins of the [Fisher Price Phone](https://encrypted-tbn1.gstatic.com/shopping?q=tbn:ANd9GcQx-OzS7eSaVPMDfU22rok2rxGerlSNIWxLihlKujKaJAuqTOvY5gr461FkO-T96Yd2kZFS6xQ5I6oOi2uoUokslzwJH4IQrw).... 

If any studio execs are reading, here's my take: You've had it good for a while. You've been making easy money hand over fist with comic book movies and space wizards but that time is over now. It was a good run. Now please give us something new and we'll come back, promise."	/r/movies/comments/1779tr6/blockbuster_season_2023_is_over_and_as_a_38_year/	https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1779tr6/blockbuster_season_2023_is_over_and_as_a_38_year/
barbie	movies	173pucj	1696852300	although it is a good movie, i'm kinda iffy on whether or not little miss sunshine deserved a best picture nomination.	"like a lot of people, i really like little miss sunshine. the film is funny, has great acting, is very well written, and has lots of heart to it. it's one of only a few comedies that actually manages to get me on the ground laughing.

the film was nominated for four oscars, two of which it won. it won for it's screenplay and alan arkin's hilarious and really good performance. abigail breslin also earned herself a best supporting actress nomination which she would lose to jennifer hudson. even people who don't care about the oscars have admitted that little miss sunshine's wins and nominations were well earned. however, you may have noticed that i haven't mentioned the fourth award it was nominated for. you see, the film was also nominated for best picture.

like i said, i really like little miss sunshine a lot. however, is it really best picture worthy?

i mean, the film has lots of heart and lots of really good drama. however, there are many comedy movies that have both really funny comedy and heartfelt drama. the muppet movie has both those things so why wasn't it nominated for best picture?

little miss sunshine was nominated alongside the departed, babel, the queen, and letter from iwo jima. among these movies, little miss sunshine sticks out like a sore thumb.

""ok, here are the nominees for best picture for the 79th academy awards. we have one of the best gangster movies of the century, a gripping drama about the lives of several different people across the world, a bio pic on a british monarch, a utterly dramatic world war 2 epic, and...a roadtrip movie. let the voting commence!""

i think we're about to see this same thing happen with the barbie movie. the closer we get to the announcement of the best picture nominees, the more likely it seems like barbie is going to recieve nominations. now, i'm not saying it shouldn't be nominated for any oscars. it should definately get some production design and costume design nominations and maybe even some acting nods for robbie and gosling. but, come on people."	/r/movies/comments/173pucj/although_it_is_a_good_movie_im_kinda_iffy_on/	https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/173pucj/although_it_is_a_good_movie_im_kinda_iffy_on/

With Barbie and Oppenheimer behind us, and Flowers of the Killer Moon around the corner-- what are your favorite movies of the 2020's so far?	"I just finished rewatching Bottom's last night. It was even better on a 2nd viewing-- with its tone fully gelling and a lot of small moments landing even harder (or suddenly being noticed on my end).  In an era where great comedies have been few and far between, I think it's going to go down as one of my favorite films of the decade.

I've been etching out a list of my favorite films of the decade over the past couple months, and working to rewatch a number of them. Obviously, it's been an odd couple of years for film-- with television reigning king with a lot of viewers and the pandemic deeply effecting productions.  That said, there have still been a lot of excellent films even if many of them have gone unnoticed.

It feels like an odd time to drop a top 25 list considering Killers of the Flower Moon is right around the corner, but here is my list:

barbie	TrueFilm	16a7ymz	1693870719	On the stereotypes in Barbie (2023), the contradiction of the film in alleviating stereotype	"I'm sure many of you are aware of the viral trend “Barbenheimer” and you might have already watched both instances. The article aims to elucidate some of my observations after viewing “Barbie,” not Oppenheimer as the Nolan pieces are notoriously difficult to deconstruct, and I'm conscious of my incompetence in commenting on them. As readers, you might already be wondering why am I discussing a trend that is waning?

Admittedly, I was hesitant to watch “Barbie” after hearing certain critiques and subsequently forming a negative impression about it. The fact that I prejudged an idea without examining it firsthand, as was the case with watching “Barbie” myself, is regrettable. Thus, I am grateful for the opportunity that allowed me to chance upon watching it and reshaping my perspectives.

The purpose of this essay is to delve into one of the central themes in “Barbie,” namely stereotypes, and to illustrate the performative contradiction presented in the film.It is not to criticize and label the film, as such actions can inadvertently contribute to the creation of stereotypes and impressions.

It is evident that the film “Barbie” attempts to address the theme of stereotypes as seen in the choice of the protagonist, Stereotype Barbie. However, following my viewing of the movie, I argue that while it aimed to challenge stereotypes, it fell short of providing a comprehensive depiction and, paradoxically, contributed to the construction of additional stereotypes.

Spoiler alert! The story commences with the stereotypical Barbie waking up and beginning her day in Barbieland. Here the film presents typical cliché impressions of the Barbie world: everywhere is adorned in pink, as if it were the favored color shared by all girls. Ken, another protagonist, attempts to capture Barbie's attention portraying it as the innate nature of men.

The story reaches its climax when Barbie plans to take over Kenland. Sasha's mother rants and raves on the unrealistic social expectation placed on her which inspires brainwashed Barbies and prompts them to awaken from subordination.

The film highlighted the set of stereotypes imposed on females by society. It suggested, through the advancement of the plot and the element of self-reflexivity, that females should awaken and combat it after the recognition of the absurdity of the set of rules.


However, the very motion to subvert fabricated stereotypes in the film inevitably generates another impression among the audience which is characterized by “Wokeism” where individuals are alert to prejudice and discrimination among different groups, in this case between different genders.

Moreover, several aspects of the film served to subtly reinforce existing stereotypes, particularly if audiences are unaware of it. For instance, the film shapes a wise image of Ruth Handler, the woman who advised Barbie at last and it aligns with the generalized stereotype of a wise individual: aged, wrinkled and white-haired. Another example is the casting choice and the use of cosmetics, with each character presented to appeal to the audiences. Even the “Weird Barbie” was dressed up beautifully as opposed to the ugly narration in the film. This contrast aims to appeal to the audiences for reaching emotional congruence.

It is inevitable that information becomes distorted, reduced and reinterpreted through media transmission. As said in media ecology, ""the medium is the message"". It is impossible to faithfully present the whole picture without distortion. The idea put forward in Barbie in the form of a movie is altered when viewed in the lens of the medium itself, namely movie. The underlying predicament lies in “Barbie” intending to subvert stereotypes within a media where stereotypes are inherently created.

I would reiterate my intention again not to condemn the film in its whole. In fact I found many details of the film intriguing, such as the use of color scheme to achieve visual harmony and elicit matching emotions. My aim is to offer an alternate analytical approach to comprehending the film and fostering critical discussions."	/r/TrueFilm/comments/16a7ymz/on_the_stereotypes_in_barbie_2023_the/	https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/16a7ymz/on_the_stereotypes_in_barbie_2023_the/

barbie	TrueFilm	15mk3oy	1691598530	What Barbie Taught Me About Mattel	"What I learned about Mattel from the Barbie movie is that they are very good at capitalism. The best capitalists are willing to exploit any and every resource they can get their hands on, and that includes themselves. 

Mattel exploited the resource of their own brand identity by allowing it to be used as a form of self-critical mass media. 

They were willing to reckon with the discourse around the history of Barbie because in doing so, they create another way for the public to engage with it, and consume more of it through film, merch, and other Barbie related IP. 

It’s a calculated risk on their part - on the one hand you’re publicly endorsing a strong criticism of your own history, product and brand, which, if the film was received poorly, could lead to long term damage to Mattel’s profit potential. 

On the other hand, if it goes well, you’re creating a product with mass appeal and billion dollar revenue potential while resetting the perception of an American icon and expanding its profitability for decades to come. 

This was the part of the movie with which I had the most difficult time reconciling my thoughts. 

The commentary on commercialization and over-consumption felt authentic and well-delivered, but a part of me couldn’t let go of the fact that the capitalist entity the movie was criticizing was also the film’s key stakeholder and financial beneficiary; it’s a lot like “eat the rich” films that are backed and distributed by the very rich people the film satirizes, who in turn become even richer from said film. What made this dissonance even more apparent in Barbie is that the large part of the second act where Barbie comes face to face with the corporate overlords pulling her strings is bookended with the most hilariously in your face product placement for Chevy (the chase sequence that went on way too long). It didn’t negate the film’s very sharp commentary on capitalism, but that was the one part of the movie where I was pulled out of it a little…it was just a little jarring. But to be fair, the relationship between art and commerce is always jarring. Finding the right balance is a moving target at best, a logical paradox at worst. Depends on how cynical you’re feeling. 

With all that said, I absolutely loved Barbie and I felt that its exploration of structures of power, feminism, and existentialism were incredibly well crafted, insightful and personal. As much as it felt with larger themes, Barbie felt like a deeply personal expression of Greta, showing us her own ideas and experiences of what it’s like to be a woman in modern society. That just feels like such a difficult thing to do in a pop movie about a plastic doll that also earns 1 billion in revenue. The fact that Greta and team were able to bring their vision to life like this while also appeasing the commercial side of the equation is so freaking remarkable.

barbie	TrueFilm	15mgnc4	1691590694	Broey Deschanel made the best piece I've seen about Barbie Discourse™	"The main point is that it’s fair to critique consumerism, commercialism and capitalism, even though it’s a cliché of sorts. From Gerwig’s decision to work with Mattel, the unabashed mass instrumentalization of feminism to sell toys, to the weird imperative to just enjoy Barbie and not criticize it. I think that it’s a good movie, even if a bit verbose.

These days I assumed a position to just enjoy silly things, without thinking too much. I felt that there wasn’t any point to it, because it wouldn’t change anything. I sort of reserved my thoughts to “real politics”: material (instead of “cultural”) analysis in order to understand reality. I guess I’m sort of tired of the“culturalization” of every political problem, almost like everything was just empty “woke” discourse without any stakes. But I think I’ve underestimated the importance of cultural analysis, and I wonder about it's place in the world.

Anyway, here’s Deschanel thoughts. What do you think?

“If we are past being critical of corporations trying to sell us stuff though art then we may as well give up.

For context, I'm seeing a lot of ""Be like Allan"" commentary on TikTok and other places, as Allan being held up as the individual man who defends Barbieland and defeats toxic masculinity. And/Or him being broadcast as some kind of queer identity character.

I don't think he's a queer take because that's just how Michael Cera always plays his characters. ~~And also there is an actual trans actress in the movie who kind of takes care of that role for us.~~

I do agree with some that he doesn't fit the stereotypical role of toxic masculinity that we see in the other Kens, but I also don't think Allan exists outside of patriarchy. He is perhaps an Ally, but I don't think he's someone to aspire to. In some ways, I think he's reflective of Barbie. Let me explain.

Barbie wants to take the heel (blue pill) from Weird Barbie and later explicitly says she doesn't want to fix patriarchy and wants leaders to fix the problem. During her breakdown, she is very much like white woman turning a blind eye to social ills because it's too hard and in part because she largely benefits from the system until it changed and ruined everything. The same way that patriarchy works for some women and men in the real world, matriarchy works for Barbie. Faced with a paradigm shift, everything gets too hard and Barbie collapses. Barbie is forced by women of color (who also flee) to face and fix their problems.

Allan similarly is running away from Barbieland with America Ferrera and Sasha. He benefits from both the matriarchy and the patriarchy but doesn't really want to change it on his own because it doesn't really hurt him either way. He exists outside the system because he's different, he's not a toxic guy but he actively removes himself, like so many of us do. He can live with it.

During Barbie's meltdown argument with Ken (where he's standing on the Hummer), Allan is deliberately placed in the background of the Dojo Casa House with his back turned away from them. If he was the character folks think he is (i.e. Be like Allan), he would've said something, but he didn't. Other characters are pantomiming in the background, but he is conspicuously present but inactive.

I think to answer the question, ""What is Allan's purpose in this movie?"" I say, his purpose is to show us with complacency looks like. Ultimately, Allan's character doesn't grow. It is actually Ken who grows: ""I'm a liberated man now, I know crying isn't weak."" Ken now has an active role in evolving their society. Allan is maybe already there internally or perhaps he's not quite aware yet. He's more of an ally, but I don't see him as someone to be like.

What did you get from watching Allan?

**Edit:** I'm striking out my dismissive comment above. I didn't mean for it to come off as tokenizing, more just kind of trying to pass on that argument altogether without much explanation. I think this TikTok explains better what I would say about Allan being viewed as queer [https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZT8LGGKkU/](https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZT8LGGKkU/) . While it makes sense that people see themselves in him, I don't think it's an exclusively queer experience, though that doesn't mean people shouldn't see themselves in that character either.

barbie	TrueFilm	15iadg5	1691179705	The Barbie Movie Ending Doesn't Sit Right	"Okay first off, a lot of the conservative talking points about the Barbie movie are that it's anti-men are intuitively false. The messaged clearly conveyed throughout the film, i.e. Ken's arc, is that the patriarchy is damaging to both women and men, overtly so for women, while it forces men into the toxic-masculinity we now associate with being unable to express emotions and forced into sort of hyper-masculine displays, which is clearly parodied in the film to draw attention to how it distracts from one's individual identity. However, could anyone explain how the ending of the film isn't misandrist? Not referring to stereotypical barbie and her conversation with Ken, which drew attention to the aforementioned points, but more so to how, throughout the entire movie, Barbies treat Kens as second-class citizens, they subjugate them to their own lesser part of town that they haven't even heard of, and they do not hold any positions within society. The ending of the movie is a return to this status-quo, with president barbie essentially saying, 'no, you cannot have any position of power \[the supreme court\], but you can still be subordinate in a more meaningful capacity'. So essentially all is well again in Barbieland as the constitution enshrining oppression of the Kens is reinstated but at least they can wear judge robes now? To be fair the Kens were essentially just insurrectionists, but the previous status-quo was the equivalent just opposite. Why could the movie have not just ended with, ""let's enfranchise all members of Barbieland so everyone can work towards the betterment of society""? To be clear, I think pretty much all claims of Barbie movie being anti-men are unfounded and I quite enjoyed most of sub-text, but the ending does not sit right with me, but perhaps I am missing something?"	/r/TrueFilm/comments/15iadg5/the_barbie_movie_ending_doesnt_sit_right/	https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/15iadg5/the_barbie_movie_ending_doesnt_sit_right/
barbie	flicks	15hku40	1691108413	I didn't like Barbie, here's why.	"There's a scene in the real world, where our Barbie sees an old lady. Touched by everything around her, Barbie tells her, in tears, that she is beautiful.

A touching scene, until a question pops in your head. DIDNT YOU FREAK OUT AT A SINGLE CELLULOID CELL? 

Dude, she shouldn't even comprehend what an 'old lady' is. She probly shoulve screamed 'Monster!' and ran away. 


It is a story of Barbie realizing that women don't always need to be perfect. But instead of actually exploring the self-hate that Barbies set for modern women, it quickly moves on to making fun of men. 

Making fun of men is super fun, no doubt. Gosling is slaying it left and right. But since the world has no rule that makes sense, defeating them is a hollow victory for a hollow battle. 

Byt how do they defeat men? By making the president Barbie president again. Then it goes on to preach about how women don't need to be perfect. Jarring. 

Wacky satrical comedies are fine, and the movie does a superb job at that. But it fails to gell that with the core theme, making it a slapped-on lecture. 

Which is a shame, because I like what it's trying to say and I like the colorful satire they're doing. 

At least my eyes are happy."	/r/flicks/comments/15hku40/i_didnt_like_barbie_heres_why/	https://www.reddit.com/r/flicks/comments/15hku40/i_didnt_like_barbie_heres_why/
barbie	TrueFilm	15e325d	1690768452	My thoughts on barbie as an asian woman	"So i just watched Barbie and as an asian woman from asia, I'm not sure if I enjoyed Barbie or not.

On one hand, I loved Barbie's portrayal of the struggles women go through and still resonated strongly with America Ferrera's speech and Margot Robbie's bit about not feeling like she's enough. (Although that throwaway line of haha margot robbie's the wrong person to cast bc she's pretty so she doesn't have these struggles is a little iffy to me but that's another conversation)

I think that also shows at the very least that women across the world have enough shared experience that we can relate to the feminism depicted. In fact, everything in the movie about the female experience, I agreed with and resonated with, and feel Greta Gerwig did a great job potraying.

On the other hand, I'm not sure I like the way the Kens are portrayed and I'm not sure if there was really any reason to have them in the movie at all if their only role is to be satire or the butt of the joke.

Annoyingly, on the surface I have a lot of the same comments as men who dislike the movie simply because they were uncomfortable with how they were portrayed - I didn't like that the men were just dumb idiot incels when they're supposed to represent women in the real world given the flipped universe that Barbie presents. I didn't like that they didn't get real roles in Barbie congress at the end and were basically voted out again, distracted by their dicks because duh men are dumb. I didn't like how little demonstrated growth Ryan Gosling Ken had (a marketable hoodie with cute designs are not kenough to show the Kens understood the message). There's more but that's the main gist.

I like to think that my opinions come from a different place from these men and I'm crossing my fingers that they do lmao because if not, rip.

Anyway, after reading more opinions, I think I understand better now that the Kens were never supposed to be vehicles for men to identify with. They are supposed to be a satire of how the patriarchy makes men want to act and I understand that it's meant to be a joke on society and toxic masculinity. If a man truly sees themselves in Ken and doesn't see why that's bad, they really need to check themselves.

But I still don't feel that the distinction between real men and the kens were made clear, because the real men we see are also idiots. The businessmen are basically sexist but also not, because they represent mattel and we can't have sexist mattel!!!! But they still come off as weird, incompetent and most likely at least closet sexists. Gloria's husband is a dumb white guy who's stuck on duolingo and doesn't have more to add than bad spanish. I didn't even realise Gloria's kid had a dad for 80% of the movie lol. Every other man that Barbie meets is a non-named character and sexist. (Thinking about the construction workers and people at the beach)

The only man that non-asshole males can viably identify with is Alan but I don't think his role is big enough to serve as a good vehicle either. And it seems he's gay coded which slay but still doesn't give straight men, the cause of patriarchy, a clear role model to follow.

I understand the argument that a movie is not obliged to make every audience member feel seen or even to fix some big abstract issue like sexism, but for a movie touted as the feminist movie of the decade, I thought it could do more for teaching people how they could dismantle the patriarchy as opposed to simply F the patriarchy, F men.

I think my criticisms come from the difference between the kind of feminism I wished Barbie portrayed vs the one they did. While I wished for a movie that would prompt actual change, the Barbie movie feels more like a call for introspection about self and about gender's role in society. Not a bad thing at all, and hopefully the conversations that have been sparked have helped more people understand the issue.

But I do wonder if maybe, at least part of the reason my experience of the movie is the way it is, is from my experience as a woman. 

My country is not outwardly sexist and I don't personally experience sexism day to day, especially not with people of my generation. People in older generations of course still have hold out expectations of women having kids, etc but as a whole I don't experience everything american women do, like catcalls, unnecessarily sexual behaviour from other people, outwardly unequal treatment, etc. 

From that lens, the simple F the patriarchy message of the movie seems less satisfying and productive than one that shows real change, perhaps because I don't have enough of those same experiences (although i do love the I am barbie you are ken thing, and it's definitely a step in the right direction but not a clear enough message because the Kens don't seem like they really got it, outside of some hoodies and sudden newfound interests in fur)

But i also acknowledge any solution Greta Gerwig would have pushed, would have felt insufficient and oversimplified given the limitations of the movie, so perhaps the ending it had was the best it could have hoped for.

So I'm curious how everyone thinks their culture, gender and experiences affected their viewing of Barbie, and whether any of my criticisms resonated with anyone!

I'm especially curious about how an american woman's views of the movie might differ from mine and how trans, non binary and other queer people viewed Barbie in general.

EDIT: woah, thanks for all the insightful comments and award!!! I'm probably not going to be able to reply to everyone, but I'll still read through everything!

I've also changed my thoughts on a lot of things, eg my viewing of Ken and really appreciate the discourse. I'm definitely due for a second viewing of Barbie to pick out more details!"	/r/TrueFilm/comments/15e325d/my_thoughts_on_barbie_as_an_asian_woman/	https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/15e325d/my_thoughts_on_barbie_as_an_asian_woman/
barbie	TrueFilm	15dho0y	1690710789	Barbie feels nihilistic to me	"I'm writing this to better understand my reaction to this movie. I was actually really looking forward to it but left the cinema slithly disappointed (it being dubbed didn't help). I think that this movie is at the end of things somewhat nihilistic or defeatest. Aside from Ken having to find himself (which I loved!) it doesn't offer any solution or even ideas on how to free women and men from the claws of patriachy or other power structures. It seemed quite blind to them actually. The feminism was very explicit and a bit flat but I didn't hate that because on one hand a lot of people still need to hear explicitely how women suffer in everyday western life and also because it fit the simple barbieland but it didn't go beyond or further. Apropos simple barbie land: I liked that the real world was much more complex and that barbie decision to become a person meant excepting conflicting emotions and such. I was actually afraid that the last scene might be a job interview at Mattel but luckily it was a doctors visit instead. But still I couldn't shake the empty feeling. The real world is just as bad as before and barbieland mimick their power structures. Mattel still is a bunch of dudes selling problematic images to girls and all barbie does is trying to survive as a women in the real world with no fighting spirit. I know that this is realistic, right? Barbie didn't create these power strctures and she can't tear them down. But for all the talk about feminism and hardships of women's life the movie seems to just except that as inevibitale and the world goes round.

I Hate Barbie

1. “Irrepressible thoughts of death”

My hometown of Amherst, MA was so liberal that no one ever made fun of me for having a lesbian mother.

From birth I was taught to hate Barbie. She was predatory and damaging to young girls. She was anorexia personified.

While I still call myself a progressive, I’ve eschewed some of the more radical Amherst dogma for centrist positions.

But they were right about Barbie.

From the University of Oxford Press:
""In a study published in the journal Developmental Psychology, girls aged 5 to 8 were exposed either to traditional Barbies, to the Emme doll (size 16) or to no dolls (control). Results indicated that these little girls exposed to Barbie had lower self esteem and poorer body image than those in the comparison groups. These results are troubling because poorer body image is related to a host of issues such as disordered eating and weight cycling.""

And from Britannica: ""[…] in 1994 researchers in Finland announced that if Barbie were a real woman, she would not have enough body fat to menstruate.""

Barbie is peddled as an inspiration to girls with the tagline, “You can be anything,” and her 150 occupations are supposedly evidence of this.

Bullshit. Barbie is a 19-year-old fashion model who, like a porn actress, dresses up as a sexy doctor or politician sometimes. She has 150 costumes, but only one job.

I suspect girls are drawn to Barbie for the same reasons they obsess over Instagram—it feels bad in a way that is addictive.

Making women hate their bodies is profitable, and those who are best at it (like Kylie Jenner) have knack for branding themselves as uplifters of women.

They’re not.

You may be rolling your eyes at my sensitivity. “Liberals and their liberal shrinks think dolls can hurt little girls,” you say, chuckling with a self-assuredness no toy could ever impugn.

But the Barbie movie agrees with me—a spicy Latina teenager shouts as much right in Barbie’s face: “You've been making women feel bad about themselves since you were invented. You set the feminist movement back 50 years.”

She even calls Barbie a fascist.

Barbie, crying, responds: “She thinks I'm a fascist? I don't control the railways or the flow of commerce!”

A funny line, but wait—maybe the movie doesn’t agree with me, because now we’re mocking the teenage girl for calling Barbie out. What does Gerwig really think about this?

We never find out. A sickening fog of equivocation descends over the proceedings, allowing you to extract whatever convoluted message you want: Yeah, some feminists are really mad at Barbie, and they have every right to be angry, but maybe they overdo it a little—not that it’s a bad thing for women to be emotional—and hey, we at Mattel can laugh at ourselves, not that we’re dismissing your concerns, because they are valid concerns…

In an interview, Gerwig alluded to a fear of forgetting why she made the movie.

Greta Gerwig On Why She Rejected Idea Of Cutting ‘Barbie’ Scene With Margot Robbie &amp; Older Woman On The Bench

“I love that scene so much,” Gerwig told Rolling Stone. “And the older woman on the bench is the costume designer Ann Roth. She’s a legend. It’s a cul-de-sac of a moment, in a way — it doesn’t lead anywhere. And in early cuts, looking at the movie, it was suggested, ‘Well, you could cut it. And actually, the story would move on just the same.’ And I said, ‘If I cut the scene, I don’t know what this movie is about.'”

Ms. Gerwig, if the only scene that still touches your heart is an thematically-orphaned cul-de-sac, the movie is already not about what you want it to be about. The honest thing to do would be to cut the scene.

But the remnants of Gerwig’s vision do interest me. I think they’re still in the movie somewhere, lurking like a shipwreck under 13,000 feet of pink jello.

Barbie’s story begins when she finds she is having “irrepressible thoughts of death” which alienate her from the carefree inhabitants of Barbieland. Additionally, her pointed feet go flat and she develops a patch of cellulite, which we see very briefly (she reacts with horror, which is strange because one of the other Barbies is fat).

Our Barbie (dubbed Stereotypical Barbie) goes to see Weird Barbie (Kate McKinnon), a kind of witch doctor who tells Barbie that in order to fix things (her cellulite) she must go to the real world and figure out why her human counterpart/owner is sad, and stop her from telepathically projecting that sadness to Barbie.

Spoofing the Matrix, McKinnon gives Barbie a choice between a high heel and an old sandal: stay here or see the real world. Barbie chooses the high heel, preferring ignorance. Weird Barbie says she doesn’t actually have a choice and ushers her out to the real world.

This is the end of Act I, and the movie is already structurally ruined. Here is why:

At the beginning of our story, Barbie is perfect and her life is perfect—which makes it meaningless. Barbie wonders if there is something more out there, something more important than perfection.

But then, while still in Barbieland, her feet go flat and she gets cellulite.

This makes no sense. The cellulite should be the price of meaning, an obstacle she encounters along the way, and something she must accept as part of being human.

Instead, Kate McKinnon tells her that going to the real world will fix her cellulite.

How? And if Barbie is having irrepressible thoughts of death, how would seeing the real world fix that?

This is more equivocation from the filmmakers. They can’t just say Barbie is hollow and boring and it’s better to be a real woman who loves and shits and dies, but they also can’t say cellulite is bad and women should be perfect, so they hide behind a story that makes no sense.

To top it off, they have Barbie choose to stay in Barbieland, maybe because it would hurt the brand if she actually wanted to leave Barbieland of her own accord.

Ironically (given America Ferrara’s third-act monologue about expectations of women), our main character is not allowed to have flaws, yet is also not allowed to be perfect, and her only driving motivation is something the movie has decided it would be too weird to talk about—existential dread.

In a later scene, Barbie meets Rhea Pearlman (playing the creator of Barbie), who waxes poetic Barbie’s inspirational legacy.

Imagine instead if they’d had the conversation Gerwig really wanted—if Barbie had touched Perlman’s wrinkly face and asked, “Is it worth it?”

What a life- and woman-affirming movie we could have had if Perlman had replied, “Every wrinkle.”

At the end of the movie, Barbie does decide to “become human,” but there is no visual representation of this happening and it feels like a tacked-on ending.

2. The Patriarchy

Back in Amherst, I was also taught that women can’t be sexist, people of color can’t be racist, and white men are the origin of all bigotry.

That never made sense to me. I saw and experienced plenty of bigotry from women and people of color.

The prevailing explanation, then and now, is that because of the broader statistical power imbalances in society, it is impossible for white men to experience oppression in any situation.

While I will passionately acknowledge the unfair dominance of white men, I won’t ignore the fact that humans constantly interact in multiple overlapping power structures of all shapes and sizes.

Yes, your female boss can sexually harass you, even if the male CEO harasses her, too. Your black teacher can be racist to you, even if the white principal is racist to him. The oppression of women and minorities doesn’t excuse their own bigotry.

The Barbie movie relies heavily on this moral fallacy to explain its awful treatment of men.

In Barbieland, men are second-class citizens. They have no power and exist solely to pathetically vie for Barbie’s attention. Worse than being eye-candy, since no one likes looking at them, they are abandoned puppies.

From the song, “I’m Just Ken”:

""'Cause I'm just Ken
Anywhere else I'd be a ten
Is it my destiny to live and die a life of blonde fragility?
I'm just Ken
Where I see love, she sees a friend
What will it take for her to see the man behind the tan and fight for me?""

Ken’s torment is played for laughs, which is odd since he’s the only relatable character.

When Ken accompanies Barbie to the real world, he supposedly discovers patriarchy—mostly he is just excited to learn that men are allowed to be doctors, bankers, and lifeguards.

But when he tries to get these jobs, he is told that being a man isn’t qualification enough. So actually he learns that he is a loser with no job or purpose.

Despite seeing no evidence of a male-dominated society in Los Angeles, Ken returns to Barbieland and indeed establishes a patriarchy where the Barbies are brainwashed out of their important jobs and into subservience (they bring the Kens beer when asked).

Barbie and her human friends (America Ferrara and her teenage daughter, played by Ariana Greenblatt) are horrified by the role reversal, and this inspires an angry feminist speech from Ferrara that would be uplifting in another context, but falls flat here.

""It is literally impossible to be a woman. You are so beautiful, and so smart, and it kills me that you don’t think you’re good enough. Like, we have to always be extraordinary, but somehow we’re always doing it wrong. You have to be thin, but not too thin. And you can never say you want to be thin. You have to say you want to be healthy, but also you have to be thin. You have to have money, but you can’t ask for money because that’s crass. You have to be a boss, but you can’t be mean.

[…] I’m just so tired of watching myself and every single other woman tie herself into knots so that people will like us. And if all of that is also true for a doll just representing women, then I don’t even know.""

(Yes, I am aware of the many similarities between this and my most recent post.)

The speech appeals to our knowledge of the broad oppression of women, but it has nothing to do with the movie. Not only is Barbie unaware of sexism against women, she has lived her entire life in a matriarchy controlled by her.

Yet, she nods wistfully at Ferrara’s speech as if it deeply resonates with her.

It makes no sense. Patriarchy is not the shape of Barbie’s hell.

Barbie is in rich white girl hell. She is tormented by perfection, purity, sterility, safety, vapidity, and incomprehensible loneliness.

Again, I mourn Gerwig’s first screenplay draft, which I imagine asked the forbidden question: “What the fuck is the point of being Barbie?”

Rich white girl hell doesn't inspire uprisings, it makes people kill themselves.

Imagine the confusion and tumult in Barbieland if Barbie showed up to the beach with cuts all over her thighs. Picture the chaos if she shaved her head like Britney Spears.

Dream with me of a Barbie movie that addresses drug use, sex, eating disorders, and family relationships—you know, the issues the target audience is wrestling with.

Of course this is impossible, because Gerwig’s crosshairs would necessarily fix upon Barbie herself. So she blames men instead.

Barbie and her friends decide to dismantle Ken’s patriarchy. How do they do it?

Manipulation.

They pretend to be interested in The Godfather, they feign ineptitude at sports, they flirt with multiple men to create jealousy.

While the Kens are distracted, the brainwashed Barbies are taken into a van and deprogrammed by America Ferrara, who teaches them feminist platitudes like: “You have to be their mommy but not remind them of their mommy.”

In the final confrontation, Ken breaks down and expresses his pain about his unrequited love for Barbie.

She tells him she doesn't love him and he needs to go figure out who he is on his own.

Suddenly inspired, Ken agrees and sets off to discover himself. But this is a different ending than Barbie deciding to “become human?” Ken is going to self-actualize without becoming human, I guess. It’s a mess.

Matriarchy restored, the other Kens ask if they can at least have one justice on the Barbie supreme court. The Barbies laugh and say no.

3. Sex

Ken: I thought I might stay over tonight.

Barbie: Why?

Ken: ‘Cause we’re girlfriend-boyfriend.

Barbie: To do what?

Ken: I’m actually not sure.

(This scene is in the trailer.)

Sexuality can be tastefully woven into kids’ movies via clever subtext, but this movie is pg-13, Ken’s sexual frustration is made explicit, and Barbie at one point literally says “he doesn’t have a penis.”

If sex is a forbidden topic, why not make Ken her actual boyfriend who is tired of being a sidekick? Instead they go for the body horror of being a horny doll with no dick.

My analysis of the baffling presentation of Ken’s sexuality is this: Ken was originally supposed to be gay.

This would explain his dogged pursuit of Barbie despite their lack of chemistry, his immediate love of Los Angeles, and his homoerotic competition with a rival Ken played by Simu Liu (a role which feels incomplete and, if my theory is correct, had a bunch of gay shit edited out).

Nope, Ken isn’t gay. He just likes pink, rollerblading, muscles, hanging out with dudes, fashion, and is insatiably horny. Maybe Gerwig told herself that the gay audience members will fill in the blanks ourselves when he goes to “find himself.”

No, fuck you.

What about Barbie?

She appears to be asexual.

I don't think she even eats anything throughout the entire film. There's a running gag where Barbie's shower doesn't actually produce water, her cups are empty, etc. During her day in the real world, she eventually learns to delicately sip real water.

Shouldn't she have eaten a gigantic Cali burrito stuffed with French fries? Don't we want to see Barbie experience burping, farting, sweating, kissing, anger, love, fear—or is all that stuff supposed to happen after the movie ends?

What if Barbie wanting to become human was the first plot point instead of the conclusion, like in a normal movie such as The Little Mermaid or Pinocchio?

Not only is Barbie sexless, she is proud of it.

Some construction workers catcall her in Los Angeles, and she is confused at first. She then explains, defiantly and proudly, “I don't have a vagina.”

The men are taken aback. Wow, she really showed them.

That's when she points to Ken and says, “He doesn't have a penis. We don't have genitals.”

Ken, humiliated, mumbles “I have all the genitals” as they walk away.

Wait, how is Barbie owning the men by not having a vagina, and also owning them by Ken not having a penis?

I guess only stupid boys like sex and genitals.

It is also noteworthy that, as Ken walks through Los Angeles in skimpy clothing, no one hits on him. So at no point does Ken ever get exposed to the idea that anyone could be attracted to him.

There is one moment of female sexuality:

During a car chase, the teenage girl asks her mother, “Where did you learn to drive like this?”

Ferrara begins wistfully, “There was this guy…”

The girl interrupts: “It was dad?”

“Yeah. It was dad.”

She and Barbie then exchange a knowing look.

What? This girl is 14, not 4. Does she really think that when her mom says “there was this guy” she is referring to her dad? Or is it that one's mother having a sexual relationship with anyone other than one's father is so horrifying that even a brash feminist 14-year-old in Los Angeles must block it out of her mind?

4. Okay but is it good?

Have you seen Suicide Squad (2016)?

This movie does a slightly better job of disguising the lack of plot momentum with needle drops and set pieces, but no, it isn't good.

It was funny when Ken took over Barbie's dream house and said: “This shall henceforth be known as Ken's mojo dojo casa house.”

Shaelin and I both laughed out loud, and then the characters promptly ran the joke into the ground by repeating it three more times in the next thirty seconds.

Will Ferrell is not funny. Michael Cera isn't funny. Kate McKinnon is kind of funny because she is great at building humorous tension, so it seems like she's always about to say something funny, which is better than nothing I guess.

It's not their fault. To be funny, jokes have to reveal something that we're all thinking but nervous to talk about. The Barbie movie is not interested in revealing anything about women, men, children, Barbie, or Mattel, so it can't be funny.

If you want to watch Barbie be funny, watch Toy Story 3.

It does feel like Robbie and Gosling come out unscathed, but that is part of the insidious manipulation of Barbie’s marketing campaign and fourth-wall-breaking aesthetic.

We’re not really making a Barbie movie. That would be lame. This is a subversion of a Barbie movie made by subversive filmmakers. Ryan Gosling isn’t really playing Ken. He’s pretending to play Ken because it’s funny. Mattel wants to sell toys because they’re a big boring corporation, Gerwig and Baumbach want to tell a story, and Robbie and Gosling are caught in the middle of this wacky clash of ideas and motivations! Isn’t that funny?

Even during the movie, the characters actively comment on this game of pass-the-buck, like when Robbie says she doesn’t feel pretty anymore, and Helen Mirren’s voiceover says, “Margot Robbie is probably the wrong person to cast to make this point.”

We had to cast a pretty woman because Mattel and Warner Bros made us.

5. There’s a fat Barbie? A trans Barbie?

Yeah. Ken might not have a penis, but somebody does…

Barbie!

Barbie can be anything, and anything can be Barbie. Men can be women, fat people can be thin, and nothing means anything.

Barbie actually does get a vagina at the end of the movie. After she becomes human, she goes to a clinic and delivers the final line: “I’m here to see my gynecologist.”

Smash to credits before anything gross or weird happens when BARBIE goes to the gynecologist.

Who’d want to see that?"	/r/TrueFilm/comments/159uk79/really_good_writeup_of_barbie_by_max_karson/	https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/159uk79/really_good_writeup_of_barbie_by_max_karson/
barbie	TrueFilm	158thxd	1690248109	Is the message of Barbie (2023) going over everyone’s heads? Let’s discuss	"Of course I’ve seen the discourse that film isn’t fair to the Kens, Kens are portrayed as victims but still viewed as idiots at the end, its ‘man-hating’, etc. However, I’d even say the movie is not quite about female empowerment either or trying to prove women are stronger or better than men. I actually feel the film is much more about giving people a different perspective on womens issues by holding a mirror to society rather than pushing a particular agenda. 

The irony of the entire movie is that Barbies treat the Kens the way men treat women in the real world - Barbie IS the patriarchy. Barbies hold all positions of power in Barbieland and are the only ones represented in roles such as doctors, pilots, etc. Ken is only good for beach and looking good, nothing else. The Kens are merely accessories to Barbie, they are the arm candy to these powerful and self-sufficient women. Ken is only happy when he is with Barbie, he is nothing without Barbie. Sound familiar? The joke is on Ben Shapiro and others who  call it ‘man-hating’, because really that’s just how men have treated and viewed women forever. 

The second act of the film comes when Ryan Gosling returns from the ‘Real World’ with a very skewed idea of what the patriarchy and masculinity is. This is where the film begins to highlight mens issues via exploring toxic masculinity - how men constantly needing to prove their masculinity and dominance not only hurts them but society as a whole. We see how it leads to wars between the Kens and promotes sexism by reducing women to objects, similarly to how it does in the real world. 

At the end of the movie we see Barbie ultimately wanting to make a more egalitarian society and encourage the Kens to pursue their own hopes and dreams. But Barbieland still only gets as egalitarian as woman currently can in the real world - for example, when Ken says ‘maybe we can even get a seat in the Supreme Court!’ and president barbie immediately shuts them down by saying ‘abosolutely not, MAYBE a seat in the House of Representatives’. I actually enjoy this ending because instead of pretending all the problems are Barbieland are solved, it shows they still have more work to do, just as we do here in the Real World.

barbie	TrueFilm	156zt07	1690071435	The Barbie movie to me seemed to be supportive for BOTH men and women. I do not understand the backlash.	"Let me know if I am overthinking. A lot of people are calling the movie as man hating, but I came out thinking it had a really good message. The Kens were all competing against each other, in this toxic struggle that I feel like a lot of men struggle with. Societal expectations often pushes men to want to be better than other men. It's like a constant struggle to need to get validation by competing against other guys. It seems men more often than women struggle with finding importance in their life and feeling valued. Part of that is feeling the need to find a beautiful woman to feel validation, that's something I felt as well. Then you have Barbie tell Ken he isn't defined by his girlfriend, he is defined by who he is. Same with the choreography dance of the ken battle. It was hilarious but at same time I feel like the message was obvious. There is no need to keep trying to compete against each other, be happy with who you are, and have a brotherhood akin to what a lot of women have in how they support each other.

Anytime time I went out with my girlfriend or an ex they would always get so many compliments from fellow women randomly throughout the day on their outfits or appearance. As men we really don't have that. No, women are not ALL nice, but in comparison to men there definitely seems to be more of a sense of sisterhood. Whereas me for example, if my friend tells me his salary and its well above mine , internally I feel bad. I feel like I need to have a salary as high as him or higher. I don't understand it, but from other guys I've talked to they also feel something similar. I should feel happy for my friend, yet I'll feel like I am inadequate. As funny as ""I am Kenough"" is, it really does address an issue we have in society. Its often why young men who feel inadequate seem to stray towards people like Andrew Tate who tell them how to be a ""Top Man"". We definitely would do better by just being happy with ourselves.

A couple other points I want to address. People say its sexist because the women in barbie land have all the great jobs and the Kens are idiots. Part of that is because no one cares about a Ken doll as opposed to Barbie so it gives the plot a good opportunity to dissect into men's feeling of self worth. Second, it is just meant to show women empowerment. People forget that in many countries women can't have a profession and even in America it wasn't long ago where you'd be shocked to see a woman doctor.

And one more thing the scene where the Kens do not get put on the supreme court. That was simply to show a parallel to the real world on how women had to go through same thing. It wasn't meant for you to think it was the correct thing to do, it was meant for you to go ""hey that's unfair! Oh wait, ah"".

Yet I see the opposite take from a lot of guys. Am I misreading the movie or was that not the obvious theme in regards to the Kens?

TLDR; The Kens showed something many men go through in society, feelings of inadequacy and needing to compete with other men. The scenes were meant to show that one should feel validation with who they are, not what woman they can win over or what other men are doing."	/r/TrueFilm/comments/156zt07/the_barbie_movie_to_me_seemed_to_be_supportive/	https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/156zt07/the_barbie_movie_to_me_seemed_to_be_supportive/
barbie	TrueFilm	156x186	1690064240	To the Shock of No One, Barbie is the Gayest Film of the Year	"And I thought Nimona was going to be the gayest film I saw this year...

I saw Barbie earlier today in a theater packed with every single white woman and gay man that live in my city. I haven't seen a crowd this hyped up for a movie since Endgame. The audience fucking loved this movie and I was right there with them. Barbie as a film is doing so much that it's hard to really take it in. The film is clunky at times especially towards the middle of the film but this actually works to it's benefit in a weird way. Barbie is so flamboyant and over the top that it instantly falls into camp. So the awkward delivery of its central films works because everything else is so direct and in your face, why not this? I have so many thoughts on the film so I'll try to organize them as best as possible here:

-The Kens collective journey in the film feels like a coming out story. In the beginning, they distilled their identities into obtaining affection from women and then being noticed by other men for having the women. There is this undercurrent of sexual angst and confusion the Kens seem to collectively have that results in them constantly competing for each other or meekly craving for another Ken's approval in the background. Ken bringing patriarchy to Barbieland is the campiest most over the top portrayal of masculinity. It very much feels like what a closeted gay man trying to fit into heterosexual society thinks straight men are like.  Kingsley Ben-Adir's shy twink character always holding sports balls but having zero idea what they're for heightens this affect. Finally the Kens give into their feelings for other Kens, demonstrated by rage that turns into the erotic. Kens are now doing ballet with each other and embracing one other. Stereotypical Ken finally stops tying his worth to possessing women and resolves to discover who he really is. He bequeaths the symbol of the patriarchy to another man, the Ken not so secretly obsessed with him. This is not the only reading of the film and I'm quite sure other people will have less queercentric takes on this, those are valid too. But damn this movie was really gay. 

-The homoeroticism was inherent to the Kens, both in the movie and the actual doll, from the start and honestly has always been a part of Ken's public image so it would seem strange not to include it. The Kens make threats to 'beach' each other off. One Ken is constantly cowering behind and silently adoring Stereotypical Ken. The Kens seem to care more about showing off for each other and winning the approval and attention of other Kens at times than Barbies. It very much reminded me of the boys in high school who weren't quite sure who they were and couldn't explain why they were inexplicably drawn to other men. The most self-aware Barbie that isn't played by Margot Robbie is played by comedic genius and noted lesbian Kate  McKinnon. She doesn't shy away from not so subtly flirting with Stereotypical Barbie and shows her the path to happiness outside of trying to live up to an unattainable level of perfection. She's the only Barbie who embraces living outside of traditional femininity and she offers up her home as a play for other Barbies off the beaten path and those incredibly gay discontinued Kens. She literally creates a safe space for queerness. 

-This film feels like 'But I'm a Cheerleader' on steroids. When the Kens were doing their dream ballet on a glowing surface of baby blue and carnation pink, I couldn't help but think of how stereotypical and distilled gender roles were portrayed in the former film. In fact, this film owes a lot to New Queer Cinema in it's exploration of gender roles and male socialization. When the Kens are fully liberated they dress in a way that wouldn't be too off from fashions I've seen at Pride weekends. Their short shorts and crop tops that adorn all of their perfectly sculpted bodies coupled with their outlandish portrayal of masculinity felt like something John Waters would do. The three Kens looking like they just came from a really fun circuit party discussing what they should against the other Kens felt like me and my gay friends deciding what we're doing for the weekend. The queer energy was so strong and it makes entire sense why it's that way. There has always been this undercurrent of homoeroticism that belies ideals about masculinity and the praising of said masculinity. I kept waiting for one Ken to declare his love to the other Ken. Maybe in the sequel. 

-For as much as the film dissected the male gaze in the real world, I thought it was very interesting how a lot of the sexualized comments delivered to Barbie weren't actually just delivered to her. If you pay attention the lecherous men are absolutely looking at Ken too. He didn't notice it for what it was because of course he wouldn't but I do like how ambiguous it was. You could and I did read it as showing how the male gaze can objectify men too. I've long said if you wanna observe masculinity and men in a vacuum just go to any gayborhood and grab some popcorn. After all, Ken is perfect. He's a chiseled blonde, blue eyed Adonis that many men wish they could be and many men want to be with. There is a lot to say about how our society also promotes unrealistic beauty standards for men as well. Every superhero film actor gently skirts around the topic of PEDs and steroids when asked about their transformations and proport to be completely natural. This film doesn't delve too deeply into that but it would've been interesting to see Ken meet men in the real world who had a negative view of what he represented. Ken has a great arc as it is but I think there was a scene missing where Ken sees that a male dominated world means a lot more is expected of men too. Also I bet the Asian and Black Kens would have had WILDLY different experiences than Stereotypical Ken and I would've been very interested in seeing how they reacted to that. Imagine going from a world where you don't even know what race is to 'put your hands behind your back, you fit a description'. You could've played it for camp but it would've been interesting commentary. The film largely sidesteps race as it relates to gender and I get it. It was written by two white people who probably felt like it wasn't their place to speak for non white men and women. I was definitely satisfied with what we got. 

-America Ferrera is going to be nominated for Best Supporting Actress at the Oscars which I am not upset by and I'll be glad if she wins. I was not expecting her to be the heart of the film nor to be the one who consistently brought the house down with her speeches. My audience literally burst into applause near the end of her first monologue. Was it about as subtle as a kick to the balls? Yes. Was it preachy? Also yes. Did it fit the tone of the film? Absolutely! Like I said earlier, almost nothing else in this film is shy nor subtle. It is screeching everything at you at all times. Everything presented is its most heightened, exaggerated and distilled version of itself. So why wouldn't the way it communicates its main thesis be this way? I can absolutely understand if you didn't vibe with the way her character was handled. It was very on the nose and in your face, but I thought having Gloria be the one to deprogram the Barbies was a great twist. Her presence in the film helped anchor it emotionally because I really do think that Barbieland is something to be digested in bites. If the third act was Stereotypical Barbie and the other Rogue Barbies doing this alone, it may have gotten very old very fast. Ferrera brought a humanity to the last third of the film that it desperately needed. 

-Speaking of maximalism, this film wouldn't work at all if the production design, costume design and hairstyling and makeup weren't on point. The first fifteen minutes of the movie where it's just pure 100% cheese was perfection and the look of Barbieland has everything to do with that. They made you want to live in Barbieland which made it all the more disturbing when Ken brings all of that to its knees. The costuming was god-tier. Many of the outfits Barbie wears in the film are inspired by actual outfits the doll has debuted. The costumes also tell a story though. In the beginning, the Barbies are dressed modestly yet still as traditionally feminine as possible. Every Barbie is hyper competent but also still hyperfeminine and none of them stray from that. Kendom sees them lose the modesty but keep the exaggeration of womanhood. After the Barbies are deprogrammed, their costumes are much more casual. We see more Barbies in jeans and sensible shoes. The actual presentation of Barbieland is a neon washed dreamland that has a hint of darkness to it. Parts of it felt like a flash game from the early 2000s. The cartoonish sparkles and dust that appeared whenever the characters did anything, the way they flung through the air like a child playing with dolls, the way Barbie falls over when she's absolutely at her lowest and Weird Barbie's entire existence was a marvel of great effects and editing. The editing in this film did wonders for selling the concept of Barbieland but also Barbie herself. In particular, I'm thinking of the moment where Barbie finally finds Sasha and introduces herself. Barbie is highly saturated and brightly colored yet the real world around her is shades of brown, grey and black. Her hyper realized form of womanhood visually clashes with the down to earth vibe of women in the real world. We see plenty of attractive women in the real world, but none of them are presented as overly glamorous. Only Barbie struts around as a manifestation of unrealistic beauty standards. The film itself pokes fun at this with Helen Mirren's narrator pointing out the folly of casting Margot Robbie as a woman who doesn't represent idealized perfection.

-The music for this movie was top notch in every respect. The actual score bounced between campy and cartoonish with accented 'aah's' and 'la's'  in the score and the eerie and reflective. Ken had a musical motif that was very unsettling but felt appropriately childish at the same time. As his character began to become distorted by the real world, so did his motif until it exploded into his own rock ballad. The music actually written for this film was equally fantastic. The Lizzo song that goes from fun dance party to existentialist nightmare was glorious. I've heard Dance the Night a lot this summer but seeing it in context was something else to behold. This film did the impossible by getting me to like a Billie Eilish song. And of course, I'm Just Ken is a fun glossy emotional bop that I'm sure will get nominated for an Oscar. 

-Ryan Gosling has deservedly gotten much praise for playing Stereotypical Ken but the other actors playing Ken deserve equal praise. Simu Liu plays an excellent jockish bro who has an obsession with another Ken for reasons he can't quite explain. Seeing Kingsley Ben-Adir go from playing the very ruthless and coldblooded Gravik in Secret Invasion to a super bottomy Ken doll hopelessly in love with another Ken doll was a wild ride. Michael Cera was the perfect accent to the sickening sweet performance of traditional gender roles. Also I cannot believe they got Sugar Daddy Ken and Magic Earring Ken into the movie. It was interesting how the Kens that were queer coded the most were the ones to instantly side with the Barbies. It makes sense because the patriarchy doesn't really serve them much if they want to be themselves.  Alan is the only one of him because he knows who he is and thus doesn't want to be a part of Kendom. Alan is essentially what it felt like to be the only openly gay guy in high school in 2005. He even wears a mesh top to the dance party. The Kens fighting on the beach had so many lustful shots of men's perfect muscular bodies heaving against one another and committing acts of athletic prowess. It was so sanitized and childlike yet so inherently horny that it brought me back to being that confused gay boy in the locker rooms back in '04.

-I appreciated how diverse the Barbies themselves were but they did something interesting with the idea. There's Barbies of every race and ethnicity but this is never brought up nor is race much of a focus at all in this film. There's a trans Barbie but she's treated no differently than any other Barbie. There's a fat Barbie who is treated as if she's just as perfect and beautiful as the other Barbies. There's a wheelchair bound Barbie but she's not relegated to being in the background or on the margins of society. Her disability will never actually be an issue in Barbieland. Each woman while representing a different type of woman is still the most perfect version of that woman. I was expecting us to be in for a real bad time when Ken took over but to my surprise the Barbies of different races, gender identities and disabilities were not treated any different from the white able bodied Barbies in that they were all treated like mindless objects. Kendom was actually quite progressive in that regard although had the Kens continued to rule who knows how that would've eventually shook out. It also underscored how Stereotypical Ken was less malicious but was moreso acting out due to not really knowing his place in the world and still craving Barbie's attention. 

-Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling were perfect castings for this film and so much of it works largely due to how invested in it they were. Margot Robbie gets to show off every tool in her acting toolbox for the first time since I, Tonya. It's hilarious that a Barbie film is probably her best and most fleshed out role to date. Ryan Gosling as adorable himbo Ken was one of the many highlights of the movie. They knew exactly what they were doing getting this very masculine and muscular man to act like an immature closeted frat boy while his body was on display for two hours. Ken making me feel all the feels while a bunch of Kens campishly shout 'Boy's Night' was quite an experience. Margot Robbie has been called a human Barbie doll before in her career so casting her as  'the Barbie you think of when you think Barbie' was sublime. She gives a performance that bounces back between pure camp to existentialist horror to straight dramatic on the dime and sometimes within the same scene. 

-The film's tone was incredibly disjointed and this actually worked for me but I can see how it wouldn't for others. Some people feel as if the story itself was disjointed and I'm gonna pushback on them there. If you view the story in vacuum, all of the beats make absolute sense. How these beats are executed is where things get a little dodgy. The campiness of the first fifteen to twenty minutes juxtaposed with the emotional rollercoaster of the last third of the film was brilliant. It unpacked everything that was set up in the first part of the film and the ending felt satisfying. The middle portion is where it dragged a bit. My personal head cannon is that the board of executives is all Kens that escaped into the real world. These portions in a vacuum work fine but the problem is they're sandwiched between touching moments of Barbie discovering the beauty of life and the symbol of Barbie defending herself from the criticism the brand has received for years. That last portion also feels very much like Mattel slipping the screenwriters some notes because it reads exactly how I'd expect a multinational corporation to defend itself. It's poking fun at consumerism and unrealistic standards for women, both of which it aides and abets, but it's also going to make money hand over fist by selling Kenough sweaters. It's the classic game of playing both sides against the middle to ensure they win no matter what. The intense presentation of the film helps me ignore this problem but I never truly forgot it. There is a lot to be said about how capitalism creates unhealthy beauty standards and portrayals of gender roles. This film respectfully tips its hat to that school of thought but never applies it in earnestness. But why would it? It's still a film about Barbie after all.

-I did find it somewhat disappointing that the film dropped the plot point about Barbie distraught that she actually hasn't done as much for women as she thought. She never brings this up to the other Barbies nor do they interact with the real world. This was actually disappointing to me. I feel like the various Black Barbies would've definitely had a much different experience than Stereotypical Barbie. President and Writer Barbie might find the Real World to be a much harsher place on multiple levels than Stereotypical Barbie. Doctor Barbie is also an interesting case because the actress is trans but no one addresses that in-universe. Were they a Ken that decided to become a Barbie? Does this imply the existence of transmasc Ken? I wonder how she or Lawyer Barbie would view the real world. That's something worth exploring and showing how while sexism affects all women, there are definitely curves and bends to this. These are all hooks for the sequel I'm quite sure we'll be getting in about four years or whenever the strike ends. 

-The segments with Ruth Handler's ghost were a great idea that had even better execution. The harsh cut from this girl power theme blaring over Barbie outwitting a small army of businessmen was very well done. The genuine touching moment of Barbie meeting what is essentially God to her kept the film from feeling too cartoonish. It reminded you that this film is still about something at the end of the day. Barbie choosing to be a real woman with all that entails instead of just being an idea was incredibly moving and I did not expect to cry at a Barbie movie. Rhea Pearlman gives probably the best performance of her entire career, again in a fucking Barbie movie. This film surprisingly had a lot to say about humanity and self worth and what it means to be alive. It's hard to believe that touching scenes like this are preceded by Will Ferrell giving us exactly what he's been giving for twenty years and succeeded by Barbie proudly going to a gynecologist. Again that tonal shift will not be everyone's cup of tea, but it was very much mine. 

Overall, I found Barbie to be a film that was much better than it honestly had any right to be. The performances were top notch. The production value was INSANE, the music was distinct and fun, the messages were timely and also very direct. It has flaws like some unneeded padding and tonally it could've been a lot smoother. But those issues didn't really bring down my experience as a whole. I do wonder about the scores of parents who brought their kids to this only for Barbie to have an existential crisis and loudly declare she doesn't have a vagina. There's gonna be a lot of kids asking their parents about 'what happens when we die?' and 'why are we born?' Good luck y'all. I give it a 9/10. Instant classic."	/r/TrueFilm/comments/156x186/to_the_shock_of_no_one_barbie_is_the_gayest_film/	https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/156x186/to_the_shock_of_no_one_barbie_is_the_gayest_film/

He directed one good film with A New Hope (he gave Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi to different directors), three medicore films with the prequel trilogy and one bad film with THX 1138 (in my opinion, it was probably one of the most boring movies I ever seen). 

Even his stuff that he produced outside of the first three Indiana Jones movies were quite mediocre too with a few exceptions and he didn't even direct or write the scripts for Indiana Jones at all.

I know this is unpopular and will probably get some downvotes, but for me, Temple Of Doom has always been my favorite and still is. Raiders is a very close second. I enjoy the other three as well and find they're interchangable and my placement varies depending on my mood. I find the other three have their ups and downs.

* Last Crusade - More nostalgia for this than the latter two sequels from catching it non-stop on the USA Network back then. Enjoy the interplay between Indy and his father which is no doubt the high point. The boat, motorcycle and tank scenes are awesome , I dig the Grail trials and the Grail theme is among my favorite pieces of music from the series. But it's too repetitive of Raiders with the Nazis again, I hate what it does to Brody and Sallah, and the villains are the dullest of the series for me. Not a fan of the more family-friendly tone compared with the more Horror-like TOD. Plus for some reason this one just isn't as rewatchable. I rarely watch it unless marathoning the entire series.

* Crystal Skull - Great seeing Indy back and Ford shows even older he still has it as the character. Enjoyed having Marion back, Spalko is a cool villain, the Crystal Skull is a neat relic and I like the 1950s backdrop and how the UFO and red scare zeitgeist is reflected. But it's got too much CGI which at times makes it feel video game-y, Mac and Oxley are both utterly useless and the film feels like it would've been significantly improved without them. It also probably arguably took a decade too long to get made. Much like TLC, another I usually only watch when marathoning the entire series.

* Dial Of Destiny - Great having Indy back a final time. The dial itself is a neat artifact, Voller is the best villain since Mola Ram. I enjoyed the chemistry between Indy, Helena and Teddy, which gave me some strong TOD vibes. But much like 4, it felt like to came too far too late and it's obvious with Harrison's much older age it was never going to be an action-intensive film. And like the two before it, somewhat low on the rewatchability barring a marathon.

A classic series for sure. I get Raiders being the best in many ways but TOD for me is the most entertaining. My very first Indy film and what an introduction to the world of Indiana Jones at the age I saw it at. An all-around amazing series and I'm glad we got a fifth and final film. The fifth wasn't perfect but I think it was as good as could've been coming so many years later and was a solid series finale.

indiana_jones	movies	1okzeyc	1761928536	What’s a movie you think its director made too late / early in their career?	"Tim Burton’s *Alice in Wonderland* from 2010 is easily one of his most disappointing works, but I could also easily see a world where the Burton from 30 years prior could’ve made it great. The Burton of the late 80s / 90s when he was at his peak creative power with the likes of the Beetlejuice or Edward Scissorhands would have had it in him made a brilliant aesthetically fuelled film, and probably with wonderful practical effects rather than the CGI that has dominated some of his later work.


As for a movie a director made too early I nominate Steven Spielberg’s *1941*. It was a big concept war comedy with a notably larger budget than anything he had made previously, as well as being only his second movie following his breakout with Jaws. The problem was Spielberg hadn’t quite yet hit the peak of his powers and this tonally was far different to anything he made previously. Even if he held off for a few more years until after he had worked on Indiana Jones and the Goonies I think he could’ve made a far better more memorable movie."	/r/movies/comments/1okzeyc/whats_a_movie_you_think_its_director_made_too/	https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1okzeyc/whats_a_movie_you_think_its_director_made_too/

"As we know Harrison Ford reprised his role as Han Solo in the Star Wars sequels, two old man Indiana Jones movies, and appeared in the Blade Runner sequel with Ryan Gosling in 2017. All of these sequels allowed us to see Harrison Ford's different characters at roughly the same age he was in real life at the time, 60-70+ years old. However he never did it for his other movies.

Like where is Air Force One 2? Or The Fugitive 2? We could see a retired president Harrison Ford on another Air Force One plane saving the day from terrorists. And why not a Fugitive 2 where Tommy Lee Jones and Harrison Ford are now friends as old men and get framed and are on the run from younger cops/villains?"	/r/movies/comments/1oabea3/why_didnt_harrison_ford_do_old_man_sequels_to_his/	https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1oabea3/why_didnt_harrison_ford_do_old_man_sequels_to_his/
indiana_jones	movies	1nugy6d	1759247632	I watched every Steven Spielberg film and ranked them (1971 to present)	"I'd seen at least 60% of these before over the years so I decided to just start from the beginning and work my way through to the end. He really only has like three bad films, which is an amazing hit rate for someone with this big a body of work.

Ranked list below with some quick reviews on each movie. Let me know your thoughts and where you think i'm crazy for ranking something over another!

34) **1941 (1979)** I just didn’t give a shit about any of this. There’s like 5 plot lines in this and I just didn’t feel like any of them were interesting. For a farce this wasn’t particularly funny, I didn’t really laugh at any of this

33) **The BFG (2016)** - At a certain point I just burst out laughing after the Queen of England had been on the screen for like 20 minutes already and it was clear she and the government were going to continue being a major part of the film. The military all coming in at that moment too was hilarious. Genuinely can’t believe this ends with &gt;!the UK government carting off the giants to live in exile!&lt; what the fuck was this movie. Rare Spielberg miss

32) **The Lost World: Jurassic Park (1997)** - Eh, this is fine I guess? Ian Malcolm doesn’t really work as the main character and a lot of this feels like it doesn’t understand what made Jurassic Park work, but this isn’t as terrible as any of the other sequels at least. The gymnastics velociraptor kill really was quite stupid though lol

31) **The Terminal (2004)** - The Diego Luna romance subplot is fucking ridiculous, like sure what the hell lol. This was mostly fine, just didn’t really care for this

30) **Always (1989)** - Spielberg's hallmark channel movie basically but I still weirdly liked this enough? The first act before Richard Dreyfuss becomes a ghost is actually pretty decent. The forest fires all the stuff with the firefighters and planes are all shot well. The dancing scene with Holly Hunter and all the firemen is weird af though 

29) **Munich (2005)** - Just never really felt like this grabbed me? It's not bad it's just not for me. There are other films that deal with the cycle of revenge and violence much better than this

28) **Hook (1991)** - Hmmm I liked the first act and most of the setup, really didn’t care for most of the stuff with the lost boys and then the climax and finale were a mixed bag. Not as bad as I was expecting but didn’t love this. Production design and blocking and camera work is great as always though Stephen 👍 As much as I just didn’t like for the kids I did find the “is it really you Peter?” and a few other moments sweet

27) **Ready Player One (2018)** - I like parts of this but anything that’s just like “woah! You like *reference*? I like *reference* too!” immediately makes me roll my eyes. The scenes of people using the tech in the real world like in the climatic battle just looks so goofy. Everything in this regard from Wade’s “gamers rise up” monologues to seeing the people fighting in the streets and showing up with their avatars just fell so flat with me 

26) **War Horse (2011)** - The first cavalry charge is a standout sequence, the close up first time a machine gun appears was especially cool framing and conveyed just how fucked the British were. Intercutting between the soldiers charging and empty horses jumping over machine guns was pretty harrowing. Spielberg did a great job showing the horrors of the First World War. Also, unironically, great performance from the horse lol. There are a number of close ups and zoom ins on a dramatic face he’s making and I can’t help but laugh sometimes at the melodrama 

25) **Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2008)** - Not nearly as bad as most people say. The first half of this is pretty good and even the bad stuff still has some good sequences. For every ""Mutt swinging on vines"" and ""PART TIME"" moments you get the motorcycle chase through campus and fight scenes around the big sea of evil ants

24) **The Color Purple (1985)** - Great performances, always a sucker for a decades spanning drama. The Spielberg whimsical tone feels weird and doesn't really work all the time though.

23) **West Side Story (2021)** - Rachel Zegler is fantastic in this (Ansel Elgort is there too). Camerawork and blocking is great as always though. ""America"", The dance at the gym and ""Cool"" where they play keep away with the gun are the standout songs.

22) **Empire of the Sun (1987)** - Great performance from Christian Bale, easily up there as one of the better child actor performances i've seen. I cried a little at the end when he &gt;!finally reunites with his parents!&lt;. Spielberg is also amazing at directing organized chaos, the scenes during the attempted evacuation at the beginning and the military invading were especially good

21) **The Sugarland Express (1974)** - A solid pretty straightforward picture. Love a good car chase and that's basically the whole film

20) **The Adventures of Tintin (2011)** - Did not like the animation style at all but thought this was a lot of fun with a nice twisty turny mystery 👍 if only it didn’t have to look like the polar express

19) **Duel (1971)** - Crazy how Spielberg had so much juice right out the gate, this is such an impressive first feature that feels so fully formed. Love that the truck driver is like Jaws in that you basically never get a full good look at him

18) **Bridge of Spies (2015)** - Liked this more than I remembered, forgot that this is basically a legal drama. Love the classic “im a lawyer just trying to defend my client” shtick as Tom Hanks is the only one who steps up for Abel’s rights as literally everyone around him tells him he’s a fucking idiot for wanting to give him a robust defense

17) **Amistad (1997)** - Djimon Hounsou really shines in this, super underrated performance. The very opening scene where he manages to pick the lock on his shackles with the extreme camera closeups was a great way to grab your attention immediately. Rest of the ensemble also is great, when you’ve got Stellan Skarsgard, Morgan Freeman, Anthony Hopkins, Chiwetel Ejiofor, and Matthew McConaughey all in one film together you know you’re cooking.

16) **Catch Me If You Can (2002)** - Not really a lot to say on this one, solid movie with a great cast and fun premise. A good movie to watch on a Sunday afternoon. Favorite part is when Frank pretends to be secret service with Hanratty

15) **Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (1984)** - Willie Scott is mostly insufferable but this is still pretty good! The third act and escape from the mine is my favorite part

14) **War of the Worlds (2005)** - That first sequence where everyone realizes something is wrong with the weather up until after the aliens first attack was masterfully done, the panic in that scene was portrayed really well. Love how relentless this is, once the horrors start it really doesn’t let up until the end

13) **The Post (2017)** - When Streep finally makes the decision to publish (the first time) there’s this amazing effect and release of tension I felt, which makes it all the more annoying this moment is kinda undercut when they basically do the exact scene again after they find out his source is the same as The Times’, but that moment of Streep saying “go go go publish go go fuck it” is so so so satisfying. 

Really cool choice watching the publishing decision trickle down after the fact to the reporters, editorial, then the physical printing machines and guys bringing the news around town. Also love how they shoot Nixon from afar and behind, really makes him feel menacing 

12) **Minority Report (2002)** - The depiction of the future in this one doesn't feel that far off from what we'll see one day. It's not the main focus of the film but the window dressing of stuff like ""eye scans that personalize advertisements"" is a great addition to this futuristic hell. Love that this is basically Spielberg's noir detective film

11) **The Fabelmans (2022)** - Love the shot where Sammy sees himself filming his family breaking apart. The family drama and emotional core is really strong in this and the ending with &gt;!David Lynch as John Ford!&lt; is such amazing casting and a perfect way to end the film. If this was his last the ending and final shot of this would be an incredibly fitting way to close out the career of one of the greatest directors of all time.

10) **Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977)** - The initial scene where Neary first encounters the aliens when they look like headlights in his rear mirror is very well done. Crazy that he &gt;!abandons his family so quickly at the end to go on an alien spaceship lmao!&lt;.

9) **Lincoln (2012)** - Daniel Day Lewis is phenomenal as Lincoln. It’s a cliched thing to say about him at this point lol but he totally disappears into the role. He brings this amazing physicality and gravitas to the performance which makes it all more shocking when you cut to his lifeless, crumpled body on the bed at the end of the film. I audibly said “oh nooo” out loud when I realized he was heading to the theater at the end there. Really cool way they portray that part happening, ripping away the character we’d just spent 2+ hours with offscreen was a great effect

Love how the editing in this lets the scene and gazes between characters breathe before cutting to a new shot, it helps you really take in the detail and performance on screen.

8) **Saving Private Ryan (1998)** - Opening D-Day sequence is so insane. I know historians say it was actually worse than what was shown on screen but like Jesus Christ what they do show is so fucked, just countless horrific death shown one after another. 

I love the calm before the storm moment in Act 3 before the nazis assault the bridge, each character gets a nice moment of reflection before it goes to hell. Each member of Miller’s platoon feels so well developed despite the short time we spend with them, you really feel this bond and brotherhood formed between all of them 

7) **Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989)** - Always crack up at the scene where Indy accidentally gets Hitler to sign the grail diary. There’s a crazy range of emotions that Harrison conveys in the span of a second (mainly holy shit am I actually getting away with this) and it’s basically all through his eyes, fantastic performance 

Love this movie to death but some of the grail tests at the end are kinda bullshit. Not to get all cinema sins-y, but like the ""penitent man kneels before god"" to dodge the massive blades that come out of the wall and kill you shouldn’t take a genius to figure out lol. That and the “leap of faith” but actually a leap onto a pretty thick stone bridge that only works as an optical illusion from the most specific POV is like whatever, but it’s fine! I’ve just seen this a million times so at this point all I have are minor nitpicks

6) **A.I. Artificial Intelligence (2001)** - The way this progresses and builds over the course of the film is masterful, it starts as a black mirror-y “wot if ur son wos a robot” type of story and escalates into something much different and darker than what I was expecting. The second it began with a narrator talking about how we almost killed ourselves because of climate change really struck a tone and I was hooked immediately 

I don’t think I’ve ever ended a Spielberg film feeling uncomfortable and unsettled (Schindler's list aside) but this left me with such dread after finishing, the final 30 minutes especially are incredibly bleak. When the narration kicks back in &gt;!underwater towards the end!&lt; I had such a pit in my gut . Hailey Joel Osment gives probably the greatest child actor performance of all time in this. He has a lot to do and so many different personas to play in this and he and manages them all exceptionally well

5) **Schindler's List (1993)** - I held myself together mostly during this but the final 20 or so minutes had me weeping on the couch. It is kind of a big swing to end this the way it does with the &gt;!Schindler Jews visiting his grave with their acting counterparts!&lt; but it’s such an earned ending and Spielberg handles it masterfully. What a picture

4) **Jaws (1975)** - It's insane this is his third film. The final shark attack before the beach is closed is insanely well directed, the chaos of all the beachgoers fleeing is so well blocked and shot especially. 

3) **Jurassic Park (1993)** - Good picture 👍

2) **E.T. The Extra Terrestrial (1982)** - Wow! I must’ve been in the wrong headspace or something when I first saw this a few years ago (I gave it a 3/5 when I first saw it in 2021) but I loved this on a rewatch. I love the kids dynamic especially, all three of them give such great performances and really do a good job of selling them all coming back together as a family again. ET looks great and is shot well especially in the first 30 or so when he’s still a mysterious stranger to the audience. The film makes really great usage of lighting in all of his scenes which makes it really that more shocking when he’s &gt;!found by the water in broad daylight half dead and shriveled up!&lt;

This score might be among John William’s best, the final 20 minutes especially are genuinely stunning and moved me to tears

1) **Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981)** - The pacing in this is excellent, there’s not an ounce of fat on the film really it just keeps chugging along. Like, Indy and Marion are locked inside the tomb and then 8 minutes later they're busting out and fighting the bald plane guy before then immediately speeding along to recapture the Ark, the film really just does not let up at all in the best way.

indiana_jones	movies	1myo0er	1756015947	What's your favorite John Williams score? Film or scene	"One of the great things about living in LA is the Hollywood Bowl and the summer schedule. And as long as I've been here there has been a John Williams concert. He used to conduct it himself.

Tonight I went... it was great. The scores they did was Hook, Far and Away, Memoirs of a Geisha, Jaws, Indiana Jones, E.T,, Star Wars was the big ender going on for maybe 20-30 minutes. (I forgot they started the second half with Superman.)

They included smaller pieces from movies like Dial of Destiny which whatever you think of the movie this piece was incredible with a single violinist as the focus. And the Jaws score for when they all go out on the boat.

When the Star Wars segment begins a ton of lightsabers light up in the crowd... the whole place is lit up... it's pretty gorgeous.

They couldn't do all his stuff of course. It changes a bit year to year.

Oh and they did as a nod to Lalo Schifrin who just passed away 2 months ago, the Mission Impossible theme which sounded so freaking good at the bowl with that orchestra.

indiana_jones	TrueFilm	1mx4qk3	1755864585	Auteur-driven film series: is the crew the autuer?	"We're at an age of diminishing returns on long running film series. Part of the reason is that, no doubt browbeaten by the sheer number of entries, cineastes have gone from salivating over what the new Star Wars or James Bond film might hold, to feeling that to make another entry into a series is to risk ruining it.

I actually think it's an overreaction that throws the baby in with the bathwater. So many great works of art are serialized: I mean, The Odyssey is a sequel to the Illiad. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings is a sequel - in thre parts no less! - to The Hobbit. Wagner's Ring and Mann's Joseph and his brothers are in multiple parts. Does this serialized form make those works any less artistic?

I think a film series rises or falls on three criteria:

1. How good or bad are the individual entries, taken in sum, are?
2. Is the number of entries such that it's starting to get to be 'too much'?
3. Do the various entries hold together, narrative and stylistically?

Critieria \[1\] and \[2\] are surely the most subjective of the bunch: how many films in a series is too many? I'd say Marvel is too many films \[1\] for me, but its fans will tell me there's still a world full of comic-book material to explore (which I would argue is to miss the point but nevermind). 

As for how good the entries are \[2\], I've never felt that Star Wars, for example, had really managed to justify its remarkable longevity on the strength of the quality of its entries. I always felt that out of the entire bunch there was only one truly outstanding movie, and it's The Empire Strikes Back from all the way back in 1980.

Criteria \[3\] is perhaps the easiest to discuss and it's what I'll focus on today. Specifically, I want to focus on how a film series holds togerher *stylistically*. I think they key here is to have a single hand guide the series through its variosu entries. There are several film series associated with certain filmmakers: Transformers with Michael, Star Wars with George Lucas. The early Bond films were the product a small cotoire of filmmakers - Terence Young, Guy Hamilton and Lewis Gilbert - alternating on entries and followed-up by their own second unit directors in Peter Hunt and John Glenn. For a while, Harry Potter was strongly associated with David Yates.

More decorously, the current iterations of Dune and Lord of the Rings are associated with Denis Villenueve and Peter Jackson. The latter had some interesting things to say about this topic: ""When you talk about how Jaws and Star Wars created a franchise mentality in Hollywood that still exists, the only thing that Lord of the Rings did is promote the idea of backing a filmmaker on that level. Warner Bros. still does with Christopher Nolan on Batman, but even that only happens when it happens.""

At the same time, Jackson has a jaundiced view of auteur theory. All his films are credited not to his name but that of his company. ""The one credit you will not see is 'A Peter Jackson Film.' I refuse to allow that, and never will. Movies are collaborations, and I would never make that kind of possessive claim on such a collaborative piece of work."" Following this, he has - as we shall see - attempted to keep a certain team in place throughout his oeuvre.

I compare that with the Lucas example, not as part of some hackneyed, fallacious notion that Lucas somehow owes his reputation to Marcia or to producer Gary Kurtz, but simply to show that his films don't have a particularly strong cohesion in terms of either the parameters of his own involvement, but even more importantly in terms of the larger crew. 

Reddit is funky with tables so I note only a few core categories below. I've left an empty row at the point that the series swapped hands to Disney, and also tried to keep tabs with the overall runtime (sans credits):

|Film|Director|Writer|Producer|DP|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Star Wars|George Lucas|George Lucas|Gary Kurtz|Gilbert Taylor|
|Empire Strikes Back|Irvin Kershner|Lawrence Kasdan (Story credit for George Lucas)|Gary Kurtz|Peter Shushitzky|
|Return of the Jedi|Richard Marquand|George Lucas and Lawrence Kasdan|Howard Kazanjian|Alan Hume|
|The Phantom Menace|George Lucas|George Lucas|Rick McCallum|David Tatersall|
|Attack of the Clones|George Lucas|George Lucas, Jonathan Hales|Rick McCallum|Tatersall|
|Revenge of the Sith|George Lucas|George Lucas|Rick McCallum|Tatersall|
|The Clone Wars (-14.5 hours)|Dave Filoni|Henry Gilroy, Steven Melching and Scott Murphy|Catherine Winder|N/A|
|\[the series shifts hands here\]|||||
|The Force Awakens|JJ Abrams|Michael Arndt, Abrams, Kasdan (""characters by"" Lucas)|Kathleen Kennedy, Abrams|Dan Mindel|
|Rogue One|Gareth Edwards|John Knoll, Gary Whitta (story), Chris Weitz, Tony Gilroy|Kennedy, Allison Shearmur, Simon Emanuel|Greg Fraiser|
|The Last Jedi|Rian Johnson|Johnson|Kennedy, Ram Bergman|Steve Yedlin|
|Solo|Ron Howard|Jonathan Kasdan and Lawrence Kasdan|Kennedy, Allison Shearmur, Simon Emanuel|Bradford Young|
|The Rise of Skywalker (-25.5+ hours)|JJ Abrams|Abrams, Chris Terrio|Kennedy, Abrams|Dan Mindel|

So not only had Lucas - in spite of his association with the series - only directed four films and principally wrote five, but he did so increasingly with different people all around. If we had room to go deeper, the discontinuity becomes even more apparent: by hiring Shushitzky for The Empire Strikes Back, we effectivelly have a completely different camera crew with a new gaffer and grip. By Return of the Jedi, we chang DP and gaffer yet again, as well as bringing in new editors (although Marcia also pitched in), a new art director and a new costume designer. 

By the prequel trilogy, George Lucas returned to write and direct, but except for Ben Burrt, John Williams and Dennis Muren it was a new crew, and while they stuck through the trilogy except for the sound department they didn't work on the animated films. After selling the entire enterprise to Disney, there was an attempt to pull a lot of the same people for The Force Awakens: Kasdan writing and Burrt doing the sound, most notably, but it was mostly Abrams' film. Much of his crew - but not all - returned to The Rise of Skywalker, but didn't work on The Last Jedi, nor on the spinoffs.

I chose to focus on theatrically-released feature films: getting into TV films like the Ewok films would not only fail to make the series come across any better, but it would also not allow us to do an apples-to-apples comparison with the other series we explore. This, in spite of the fact that those TV films are actually as much part of Lucas' oeuvre as The Empire Strikes Back had been.

These changes help explain why the films don't, ultimately, cohere particularly well as a ""unit"". Not just because of any quirks of plot continuity, changes in scope of ambition and visuals, but stylistically as well. This is not always a bad thing: The Empire Strikes Back is a lot BETTER than Star Wars, but it also feels very different, because it has a different director and different writer. Even if the plot congeals between it and its predecessor - which I never felt was the case - we can sense that a different hand is guiding us through the piece.

Indiana Jones is somewhat more cohesive, with four out of five films having all been directed by Steven Spielberg, produced by Frank Marshall and had a story co-written by George Lucas. I actually think that's partially why it hadn't had much longevity beyond those four films: it's too associated with Spielberg for anyone else to step in and not just do a pale imitation. But even within the Spielberg entries there's still a lot of variation, perhaps made more understandable given the more episodic nature of the series:

|Role|Raiders of the Lost Ark|Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom|The Last Crusade|Kingdom of the Crystal Skull|Dial of Destiny|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|

Harry Potter hits even nearer the mark, with a staggering seven-movie directorial run from David Yates, eight-movie run from writer Steve Kloves, and all of it produced by David Heyman and author JK Rowling. Still there are big variations here: even Yates had neither originated the Potter films nor had the opportunity to bring the Fantastic Beasts films to a close. Here, too, the changes are not always to the worse: Azkaban is a lot better than Chamber of Secrets, but it also represents a huge stylistic departure from the preceding film.

|Film|Director|Writer|Producer|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone|Chris Columbus|Steve Kloves|David Heyman, JK Rowling (executive)|
|Chamber of Secrets|Chris Columbus|Steve Kloves|Heyman, Rowling|

Rather, the most remarkable example takes us back to where we started. On his Tolkien productions, Peter Jackson had been especially keen to ""draw the same people back again because they are the beating heart, they're the spirit of the film."" The number of films is smaller than in the Star Wars and Harry Potter examples, but in terms of volume - screentime and plot incident - it's almost equivalent, and that's not even counting projects under the broader Tolkien ""umbrella"" - audiobooks, a whole slew of video games and the first season of Rings of Power - that much of this crew worked on.

A very rudimentary table - going into more depth across the various departments would show an even greater unity but is beyond the scope of a Reddit post - shows how much the same people are still onboard all those years later.

There are examples like the Nolan Batmans (the less is said for any attempt to do a great DC series the better) or Villenueve Dune films, but those are much shorter film series. There would have been no room here to include the Marvel films and while some filmmakers got a run at two or three Marvel movies, on the whole they wouldn't have fared well in this study.

Nevertheless, it is significant that ***a*** Marvel ""style"" had emerged which is fairly consistent across the various films. But where other film series strive for continuity at the higher common denominator and fall short, Marvel instead achieves stylistic continuity at the cost of dumbing everyone's films down into a kind of made-for-TV action-comedy style.

I think this sort crew retention (which is to say nothing of the cast), to the varying extent that we've explored today, with the last example being the most extreme, is what distinguishes a film *series -* a group of people deciding to make multiple entries on a single subject - from a *franchise*. 

Again, Jackson has the quote: ""The studio decides what the latest, greatest 'franchise' or fad is, and they market, they shape the films and they hire filmmakers."" By the very nature that the studio (e.g. Marvel) or a willfull producer (the Broccolis for Bond) remains a constant and the filmmaking team changes from entry to entry, any sense of creative authorship is lost.

However, by the same token, even if the series retains the same captain but with a different crew of shipmates, it's never going to sail in quite the same way. But if the same entire pool of people are making the films start to finish, that is not the case. This gives film series - provided they answer the other critieria for a succesfull series - an artistic merit that's not inherently any lesser than any one-film endeavour."	/r/TrueFilm/comments/1mx4qk3/auteurdriven_film_series_is_the_crew_the_autuer/	https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/1mx4qk3/auteurdriven_film_series_is_the_crew_the_autuer/
indiana_jones	movies	1mvj519	1755706207	I finally gave Indiana Jones a go and I am disappointed!	"After years of memes and social media appreciation of the film, and countless references to the character in various TV series and films, I finally decided to give it a try. Yesterday I downloaded the film on Netflix, and today I decided to watch it. Big mistake.

Although I’m going to finish it, I had to stop myself after hearing the line: ""I was a child, I was in love, it was wrong and you knew it."" I was baffled. I can’t imagine how this film was referenced so many times in so many shows and movies, and yet not once did anyone ever mention that he was a pedo!

But that wasn’t the only thing that bothered me. After losing an ancient artifact, he casually discussed it with his colleague at the university—where he is portrayed as a good guy—for even trying to steal it in the first place for a museum. I mean, the object was safe where it was, and he stole it to be stored in a museum? That also against the wishes of the locals. I would have understood if the locals had been on board, but they clearly weren’t—at least not with him.

So, Indiana Jones who comes across as an entitled guy who thinks it’s okay to steal ancient objects against the wishes of the local population, and who had a relationship with a minor—and yet he’s hailed as a hero? A good guy?

This is disturbing. 

Edit: She wasn't 20 years old. As per the articles that I just looked over, she was 15 or something. Which is minor. Even if I finish watching the film it won't change the fact that he had a relationship with a minor. So, stop defending him with this excuse. It's a classic I understand, but it doesn't mean this can be overlooked. 

Edit 2: Bully me as much as you want, but I would not change my stance. I would never be okay with a scene that implies pedophilia and I would never bow down in front of those who find pedophilia okay. If you believe Pedophilia is okay, then you are the sicko not me."	/r/movies/comments/1mvj519/i_finally_gave_indiana_jones_a_go_and_i_am/	https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1mvj519/i_finally_gave_indiana_jones_a_go_and_i_am/

"Let me start by saying that I’m easily amused and consider a movie good entertainment if I don’t fall asleep. With that said these are the ones that come to mind for me…

One of my favorites has always been The Usual Suspects. 

The worst movie that comes to mind is Wolf, with Jack Nicholson.  I probably would have walked out of the theater if it was not for him. 

The strangest movie I have seen is Eraser Head with Pink Flamingo a very, very close second. 

When The Game came out I thought it was great. I have not watched it in a long time so not sure how it has held up, but I would not tell anyone about it, just said you need to see it. I felt it was not like any other movie I had seen at the time.

"So I was looking back at the history of the Indiana Jones movies because I started to recall how there were always supernatural aspects used in the older movies such as the aging grail as what I am trying to get at is that I tend to hear criticism from fans of the older entries that say that the 4th one felt kind of out of place with the supernatural aspects.



For instance, the part in the 4th movie that gets the most amount of criticism is the fridge scene as I wanted to take a closer look at that scene to see why it was the most disliked part of the movie as again, like I said before, I know the franchise had used supernatural elements, but I wanted to get a better understanding of what made the 4th installment so infamous, like how it could have been done better when it came to the sci-fi elements."	/r/flicks/comments/1mhhamj/how_could_the_sci_fi_aspects_of_indiana_jones_4/	https://www.reddit.com/r/flicks/comments/1mhhamj/how_could_the_sci_fi_aspects_of_indiana_jones_4/

I promise, no one will ever convince me that Godfather 1 and Godfather 2 are two separate movies. If you only watch one, you do not get the same experience as watching both congruently. (An argument can be made for the third, but I'm not going to open that can of worms here.) Kill Bill is in the same vein. 1 and 2 are separate, but equal. And yet they complete each other. Are there other movies or projects that fit this mold? And before you say it, yes I'm a huge Star Wars fan. (Rogue One is the greatest prequel ever made.) Indiana Jones belongs in the discussion, as does the original Evil Dead trilogy. But personally I do not think they fit the specific mold in looking for.

Without Indy the plan was to ship the ark back on a plane to Hitler and Hitler, having sent for it as a weapon would have most likely known what to do and would have probably had other subjects to test it on. So when Indy destroys the plane, the Nazis try to get the ark away. Understandably, them opening the ark at the end doesn’t make much sense but if the plane was to have survived then the implication is that it would have just been immediately shipped off to Hitler.

I’ve never watched the mission impossible films so thought I might do those. Watched the first Matrix film for the first time the other day so maybe I’ll watch the others.

indiana_jones	movies	1l4pwcr	1749208816	What is the Greatest Action Film Franchise?	"With Mission Impossible seemingly over for now, a lot of iconic action film franchises have seemingly had their last chapters for the past few years. A few of the film series that could be considered among the greatest Action franchises are:

* James Bond: Has had so many eras and while they've rarely revolutionized the genre after the 60s, 007 has pretty much become and institution for classic adventure and action cinema.
* Indiana Jones: Raiders is considered one of the most important in the genre. The trilogy is generaly considered well regarded, while the 4th and 5th instalments were more divisive.
* Mad Max: 2 and Fury Road have both been named the greeatest films in the genre at different points. While Furiosa floped, the film was still very well received.
* Die Hard: Similar case to Indiana Jones but the case of diminishing returns in the sequels is arguably worse.
* Matrix: First one is an all-time classic in the genre. The following 3 are very divisive.
* Mission Impossible: Fallout was hailed as ""the greatest action film since Fury Road"" and on the whole, this film series has been very consistent and well liked.
* Bourne: Trilogy is highly regarded but it seems like the franchise has lost momentum.
* The Raid Duology: Made outside of hollywood and both films had such wild stunts... soon after, Hollywood started adapting.
* John Wick: As far as I know, no single film in the John Wick has had the impact and reception of Raiders of the Lost Ark or Fury Road, but they've consistently had some of the greatest stunts in a film series. Might even be the most consistent film series in this list.

Then there are some other 80s-2000s films that are iconinc but also had varying receptions, like Rambo, Lethal Weapon and Taken.

While Mission Impossible and John Wick have often been the most referenced franchises in the genre recently, I personaly would rank Mad Max as the king of the genre. Those films have been very auteristic, have evolved A LOT and it also feels like they have been trying to be more challenging when it comes to themes and storytelling.

While most of these franchises will continue in some way, all of them have had some sort of ""Final Chapter"" recently. So i'm curious to see how others would rank them."	/r/movies/comments/1l4pwcr/what_is_the_greatest_action_film_franchise/	https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1l4pwcr/what_is_the_greatest_action_film_franchise/

Cast: John Krasinski, Natalie Portman, Eiza González, Domhnall Gleeson, Arian Moayed, Laz Alonso, Carmen Ejogo, Stanley Tucci, Benjamin Chivers, Michael Epp.

**Rotten Tomatoes:** [45%](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/fountain_of_youth_2025)

**Metacritic:** [42/100](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/fountain-of-youth/)

Some Reviews:

[Variety - Todd Gilchrist](https://variety.com/2025/film/reviews/fountain-of-youth-review-guy-ritchie-john-krasinski-1236405297/)

&gt;As a spirited time-filler, “Fountain of Youth” gets the job done, but anyone looking for a deeper exploration of the search for eternal life may find this little more insightful than a stopped clock.

[The Hollywood Reporter - Frank Scheck](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/fountain-of-youth-review-john-krasinski-natalie-portman-1236224248/)

&gt;It’s all as predictable as you’d expect, with the screenplay by James Vanderbilt failing to provide the wit necessary to make the film stand out in any way. (One exception, an exchange between young Thomas and billionaire Owen about what it’s like to be obscenely rich, stands out). By the time it concludes with the inevitable hinting at potential sequels, *Fountain of Youth* just seems desperate in its attempt to launch a viable film franchise for its streaming host.

[The Wrap - William Bibbiani](https://www.thewrap.com/fountain-of-youth-review-john-krasinski-natalie-portman-apple/)

&gt;It would be nice to report that “Fountain of Youth” is harmless fluff, a brisk escapist adventure with a game cast and a few fun set pieces. And I suppose it may be mostly harmless, unless you count wasting your time as a “harm” (and I wouldn’t fight you on that). But it’s annoying fluff. It’s tedious fluff. The only thing I wanted to escape was the movie itself. The cast is either trying too hard or not enough, and none of the action sequences blew me away. There’s a bit on a boat that was probably expensive. There’s a fight in a library that’s competent. There’s a shootout at the pyramids between characters we don’t know or give a damn about. There’s a big difference between “fluffy” and “empty.” “Fountain of Youth” seems to have found it.

[The Daily Beast](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/2345) \- [Nick Schager](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/nick-schager)

&gt;No matter his gifts for tales about motley crews, this sub-Spielbergian venture isn’t in his rough-and-tumble wheelhouse, the result being a clunky farce that never escapes its ancestors’ shadow.

[Guardian](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/205) \- [Ryan Gilbey](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/ryan-gilbey) \- 2/5

&gt;A movie as derivative and uninspired as this will always be surplus to requirements so long as the first three Indiana Jones movies remain in circulation. As the family name Purdue suggests, Luke and Charlotte’s father believed that some things should remain lost. Would that this had been the fate of the film."	/r/movies/comments/1ksufx4/guy_ritchies_fountain_of_youth_review_thread/	https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1ksufx4/guy_ritchies_fountain_of_youth_review_thread/
indiana_jones	movies	1kjd2t8	1746891386	"""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"" gets a bad rep but it's the one movie in the series which offers you the biggest thrills while also being a big fun adventure and a Horror movie at the same time (PG-13 founder?)"	"We all know Steven Spielberg hates Temple of Doom because he was going through a rough time and the film reflected his mood as well as George Lucas. 

But as someone who was not that impressed by the other Indiana Jones movies, this movie gave me everything I wanted: it was epic, it was funny, it was never boring for a second and it even made scared at one point. Spielberg rarely does Horror but when he does, you're going to have a Horror classic like we saw in Jaws and then, Temple of Doom. 

Oh, but Short Round and Willie Scott were annoying! Well, I didn't find Short Round annoying. Every kid who saw this in the 80s loved Short Round, and Short Round felt like a real kid who just so happened to be a sidekick, we could relate to him in a way I could never with other kids in adventure movies like those dorky brats from Jurassic Park (""I'm a Vegetarian!!!"").

And I like Willie Scott. First, the Anything Goes number was a stunning opening. It shows the prowess Spielberg had for the musical genre. 

People bash Willie because she's a shrieking diva but that's what she is. She's not a archeologist like Marion. She didn't even want to go on this mission. She's a character placed in a situation which is out of her comfort zone so she behaves accordingly. And I thought Kate Capshaw did a good job. The way she tries to pass on the townspeople food turning it into an even more awkward moment. And how she grows but not too much. Which is a far cry from what we see today where every female lead needs to be a Lara Croft in training. 

Harrison Ford is spectacular in it. Especially when Indiana gets possessed and becomes a temporary baddie. Ford is amazing at playing heroes but I do wish he had played a bad guy just once."	/r/movies/comments/1kjd2t8/indiana_jones_and_the_temple_of_doom_gets_a_bad/	https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1kjd2t8/indiana_jones_and_the_temple_of_doom_gets_a_bad/

indiana_jones	movies	1jhehpa	1742666476	Growing up we tend to watch “feel-good movies”  so what was the first film you watched that opened the door to enjoying other genres or more complex films?	"I grew up with a lot of Rom Coms, Disney, and pg-13 films. I’m talking Harry Potter, Indiana Jones, Back to the Future, Lilo and Stitch, Finding Nemo, 27 dresses, Just my Luck, Ferris Bueller’s Day Off etc, really safe storylines that all have happy endings and are feel-good. There isn’t much pushback and there isn’t much there challenging the way you feel or see the world.  Many are fantastic films that I still love but, I realized I never really saw films that made me feel or think anything different. 

My first film was Bridge to Terabithia. I had never grieved in a story like that and I put me in a depressive funk as a 4th grader. But I loved it. It made me think a lot about the story and I really took a weird interest in stories that were “sad” as a result. I even bought the movie on iTunes with a gift card because my parents refused to buy the DVD. I was weirdly obsessed with how this movie made me feel. But to be honest, while this was the first sad film I saw, it didn’t totally cause me to really explore a whole new range of films. 

The movies I would say opened me up to mature films was Prisoners and Her. I discovered them via “Her’s” score. Her was nominated for an Academy Award and I also discovered a lot of other films as a result of the other nominees. The poster for Prisoners being something that caught my eye. It looked dark and mysterious and I knew liked spooky things so tried it - totally blind and clueless of the plot. I discovered it neither spooky nor horror. It was dark, mysterious, challenging, brooding and grotesque.  Holy shit my mind could not comprehend. The door flew open and I wanted more thrillers and more grey narratives. I loved it and I distinctly remember thinking to myself as a young teen that I could never turn back after that film. Seriously, that movie changed my view of film and now I love movies like the Platform, Midsommar, Nightcrawler, Place Beyond the Pines etc.  Great films that are dark and complex and uneasy and whose endings aren’t clear cut. 

 As for Her, this was the first film that spoke to me emotionally in a way I didn’t know films could. Bridge to Terabithia said “movies don’t have to be happy” but Her said “Movies can be a lot of emotion.” That sounds really stupid written out but it’s the only words I have for it.  As a young teen struggling with loneliness this was the first film that spoke to that feeling and it’s not a straightforward emotion. It really opened my eyes to the fact that movies are “relatable” and can help you process more complex emotions.  I now love movies like Call Me by Your Name, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless mind, Normal People (I know l, TV show), Aftersun, Manchester by the Sea, etc 

So I’m curious what were some of your break through films if you grew up like me? 

Sorry, I have ADHD so I ramble. TL;DR it was Her and Prisoners for me."	/r/movies/comments/1jhehpa/growing_up_we_tend_to_watch_feelgood_movies_so/	https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1jhehpa/growing_up_we_tend_to_watch_feelgood_movies_so/

Reviews:

[Deadline](https://deadline.com/2025/02/captain-america-brave-new-world-review-anthony-mackie-harrison-ford-marvel-reboot-1236286418/):

&gt;Director Julius Onah (*Luce)* and a boatload of writers provide plenty of oppotunity for Mackie to show his strengths although Evans’ Steve Rogers is a tough act to follow. That fact is even alluded to at one point, but watching Mackie taking Sam Wilson into the big leagues is a game effort with room to grow.

[Variety](https://variety.com/2025/film/reviews/captain-america-brave-new-world-review-anthony-mackie-harrison-ford-1236303617/) (70):

&gt;Wilson’s Captain America lacks the serum-enhanced invincibility that defined Rogers. He’s a hand-to-hand combat badass, but far more dependent on his shield and wingsuit, both of which are made of vibranium. You could say that that makes him a hero more comparable to, say, Iron Man (though Tony Stark’s principal weapon was Robert Downey Jr.’s motormouth), and Wilson’s all-too-mortal quality comes through in the sly doggedness of Mackie’s when-you’re-number-two-you-try-harder performance. But on a gut level we’re thinking, “Wasn’t the earlier Captain America more…super?”

[Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/captain-america-brave-new-world-review-anthony-mackie-harrison-ford-marvel-1236133439/) (40):

&gt;At 118 minutes, *Captain America: Brave New World* thankfully runs on the short side for a Marvel movie, but under the uninspired direction of Julius Onah (*Luce*, *The Cloverfield Paradox*) it feels much longer. Even the CGI special effects prove underwhelming, and sometimes worse than that. It is a kick, though, to recognize Ford’s facial features in the Red Hulk, even if the character is only slightly more visually convincing than his de-aged Indiana Jones in that franchise’s final installment.

[The Wrap](https://www.thewrap.com/captain-america-brave-new-world-review/) (30):

&gt;“Captain America: Brave New World” was directed by Julius Onah (“Luce”), but like lots of Marvel movies lately, it plays like it was made by a focus group. Everything looks clean, so clean it looks completely fake, and every time a daring choice could be made, the movie backs away from the daring implications. This is a film where the President of the United States literally turns red and tries to publicly murder a Black man, and yet according to “Brave New World,” the real problem is that we weren’t sympathetic enough to the dangerously corrupt rage monster. This film’s steadfast refusal to engage with its own ideas, either by artistic design or corporate mandate, reeks of timidity.

[IndieWire](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/captain-america-brave-new-world-movie-review-1235094677/) (C-):

&gt;It’s fitting enough that “Brave New World” is a film about (and malformed by) the pressures of restoring a diminished brand. It’s even more fitting that it’s also a film about the futility of trying to embody an ideal that the world has outgrown. Sam Wilson might find a way to step out of Steve Rogers’ shadow, but there’s still no indication that the MCU ever will.

[IGN](https://www.ign.com/articles/captain-america-brave-new-world-review-anthony-mackie-harrison-ford-red-hulk) (5/10):

&gt;Captain America: Brave New World feels neither brave, nor all that new, falling short of strong performances from Anthony Mackie, Harrison Ford, and Carl Lumbly.

[TotalFilm](https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/marvel-movies/captain-america-brave-new-world-review-anthony-mackie-harrison-ford-mcu-marvel/) (3/5):

&gt;Anthony Mackie's Captain America earns his Stars and Stripes in this uneven, un-MCU thriller. Sam Wilson and an always-excellent Harrison Ford drag Brave New World into unfamiliar narrative territory before it eventually succumbs to familiar Marvel failings

[Rolling Stone](https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-reviews/captain-america-brave-new-world-review-mcu-anthony-mackie-1235251815/) (40):

&gt;While *Brave New World* is nowhere near as bad as the various MCU low points of the past few years, this attempt at both reestablishing the iconic character and resetting the board is still weak tea. The end credits’ teaser — you knew there would be one — feels purposefully generic and vague, as if the powers that be became gun-shy in regards to committing to a storyline that might [once again be forced to pivot](https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-features/jonathan-majors-kang-marvel-fired-mcu-future-domestic-violence-loki-avengers-1234931990/). Something’s coming, we’re told. Please let it be a renewal of faith in this endlessly serialized experiment.

[Empire](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/captain-america-brave-new-world/) (3/5):

&gt;Pacy and punchy, this is a promising first official outing for the new Captain America, even if some awkward and inconsistent moments hold it back from greatness.

[Collider](https://collider.com/captain-america-brave-new-world-review/) (4/10):

&gt;In trying to do so much all at once, *Captain America: Brave New World* forgets what made its title character a relatable fan-favorite. Instead, we get a narrative that is as convoluted as it is boring, visuals that are as unappealing as they are uninspired, and a Marvel movie that is as frustrating as it is forgettable. Had this been a random C-list Marvel hero, that would be forgivable, but for a character as revered as Captain America, it's a huge disappointment.

[The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/feb/12/captain-america-brave-new-world-review-harrison-ford-juggles-green-screens-red-fists-and-vanilla-plotting) (2/5):

&gt;Brave it might be, but there’s nothing all that “new” about the world revealed in this latest tired and uninspired dollop of content from the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

indiana_jones	movies	1ije5up	1738877708	George Lucas isn't a very good director and was the one that angered Star Wars fans, not Disney.	"So over those past several months, I've been looking up George Lucas and I am finding out that he just ain't all that original in his ideas. Well, I know that he only directed six movies (THX 1138, American Graffiti, Star Wars: A New Hope and the prequel trilogy) but the more I find out about him, the more I dislike him. If you thought Disney did some bad decisions in terms of Star Wars, nope. George Lucas takes the cake

So let's start off with this: he came up with the Ewoks which I could deal with. One thing I like to note is that nobody was happy that the Ewoks were being put in Return of the Jedi but George himself.

But then we got Jar-Jar Binks which is probably the worst movie character to even exist anyways. I am surprised that instead of Lucas calling Darth Vader or Han Solo his favorite Star Wars character, he calls Jar-Jar Binks his favorite character out of Star Wars. Give me a break, he probably doesn't realize that people hated Jar-Jar Binks, even after Binks' screentime was cut for Attack of the Clones and Revenge of the Sith because fans hated that character but then they bring him back for the animated Clone Wars TV show which in my opinion is bogus. He obviously didn't listen to the fans for Binks.

Then, he kills off the coolest villain of Star Wars: Darth Maul. He is my favorite villain of the Star Wars movies but then Lucas decides to kill him off in Phantom Menace. That's an another sign of Lucas not listening to his fans. And of course, the fans weren't happy about Darth Maul dying, George Lucas didn't realize that fans basically wanted Darth Maul to survive. So basically for Clone Wars and Rebels, George had to bring back Darth Maul because of how fans didn't like his death. And then when George Lucas isn't even involved in Star Wars anymore, Disney brings him back at the end for Solo: A Star Wars Story for a potential sequel tease that of course, never happens because of how badly that film did at the box-office.

Then, he also killed off Boba Fett in Return of the Jedi, also one of the coolest villains of the franchise, Fans weren't happy about Fett being being killed off either, George Lucas didn't realize that fans basically didn't like that Boba Fett died in that film. Then later on, they changed it so that Boba Fett survived the Sarlacc Pitt and Disney later brings him back in The Mandalorian and his own show, The Book of Boba Fett.

And there's a reason why George Lucas' original cut of Star Wars was changed. It was simply not very good and that film got saved in the editing room because of it. And even his original Star Wars pitch and screenplays weren't good: Han Solo being a frog? Really. And in fact, for the best film of the original Star Wars trilogy: The Empire Strikes Back, Lucas was barely even involved in that. Then, he has greater control of Return of the Jedi. Indiana Jones was mostly Steven Spielberg's movie but in Crystal Skull, he came up the idea of aliens in the movie and was the one that decided to nuke the fridge in that movie. That was some of the dumbest ideas that I heard of that made it on-screen and I can imagine Spielberg not being happy either. Howard the Duck? So bad that it is one of the worst films of all-time. And his pre-Disney sequel trilogy ideas for Star Wars weren't all that good either.

Other than that, I just think that he is an overrated director that only directed one good film: A New Hope and when I look him up every time, I dislike him more at the same time. That's my opinion on him. At least he isn't a bad wordbuilder and producer, I can say that."	/r/movies/comments/1ije5up/george_lucas_isnt_a_very_good_director_and_was/	https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1ije5up/george_lucas_isnt_a_very_good_director_and_was/
indiana_jones	movies	1i22zp9	1736962886	"How many of you liked Willie Scott (Kate Capshaw) from ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"" (1984)? A misunderstood protagonist or a screeching nuisance?"	"It might be nostalgia affecting my view. Either way, I always had a soft spot for Willie Scott, because she was a fish out of water and acted accordingly. 

Critics sometimes complain about the Mary Sue or the leading lady who turns into GI Jane in just 15 minutes, yet with Willie Scott, the spoiled Cabaret singer who's taken ""hostage"" by Indiana Jones and finds herself falling off planes and made as a sacrifice for a Satanic God, she never changes. She screams, she has temper tantrums, she cries and she is grossed out by the food. 

I liked her for it, because it's how most humans would have acted in her place, and I enjoyed Kate Capshaw's attempts at bringing screwball humor as well as showing Willie having a bit of a evolution along the way. 

She's not the smart and adventurous Marion Ravenwood, she's not expected to be. Every romantic interest Indiana Jones had in the original trilogy was different. Willie was, easily, the one leading lady who had the meatiest role since she's onscreen for most of the film. 

Can I also say the ""Anything Goes"" number in Cantonese opening number slays the house boots down? You could tell Steven Spielberg could direct a musical if he wanted in 1984."	/r/movies/comments/1i22zp9/how_many_of_you_liked_willie_scott_kate_capshaw/	https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1i22zp9/how_many_of_you_liked_willie_scott_kate_capshaw/
indiana_jones	movies	1ht7ann	1735968071	Do you think they should have stopped making Indiana Jones movies with The Last Crusade?	"We already know how Kingdom of the Crystal Skull and Dial of Destiny turned out, but what if they weren't quite as bad? What if Indiana Jones had two perfectly average sequels after The Last Crusade? 

The Last Crusade ended with the heroes *literally* riding off into the sunset. And after seeing this movie 6 times, try as I might, I cannot figure out how the *Last* part of the title references the plot of the actual movie. So it feels like the ending and the title itself all tell the audience that this is Indiana Jones' happy ending. 

With such a symbolically conclusive ending, a philosophical line has to be drawn. Barring a truly amazing legacy sequel ala Top Gun: Maverick, should they have left well enough alone at The Last Crusade?"	/r/movies/comments/1ht7ann/do_you_think_they_should_have_stopped_making/	https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1ht7ann/do_you_think_they_should_have_stopped_making/
indiana_jones	TrueFilm	1hrztwh	1735840714	Looking Back On 2024 (A Cinematic Year in Review)	"As a preface, I will only list here what I watched during the past year, which includes the delayees (is that even a word) from 2023, movies moved to 2024 due to the idiotic distribution structure of my country. These include The Iron Claw, The Holdovers, Poor Things, May December, The Zone of Interest, The Boy and the Heron, Priscilla and the Anatomy of a Fall. Some others I didn’t get around to watch or haven’t heard of before 2024, like Sisu, Kiss The Girls or Mr. Holmes. With that out of the way, let’s get down to it!

34. Rebel Moon: A Child of Fire. No surprise here, but I still think it’s a half-decent movie. I mean, of course, most of the plot is claptrap (despite a couple good in-isolation scenes), the lore is established way too haphazardly for its own good and the cinematography doesn’t provide as much gravitas or atmosphere to the scenes as it thinks it is, but Snyder still manages to squeeze out some nice performances (in particular from Michiel Huisman and the delightfully malicious Ed Skrein as Admiral Atticus Noble). And the score by Junkie XL unironically SLAPS. It’s weighty, ethereal and immersive as fuck, especially everytime chorals and angry artificial howling - Noble’s theme - can be heard on the screen. It is ultimately due to the music that the movie is not a failure.

33. Godzilla X Kong: A New Empire. This one’s merit, on the other hand, lies exclusively in the visual spectacle. Here Holkenborg could not cook up something noteworthy, but the action carried hard. I mean, mostly because the Skar King and Shimo’s battle against G and K wore off pretty quickly. The human characters were uncompelling, the story presented no interesting themes, and the visuals I found pretty below average. It was just mediocre.

32. Rebel Moon: The Scargiver. A slight bump as far as overall cinematic quality is concerned. The cinematography offers something more visually enthralling, and this time Snyder’s time wasting pays off in a way. Holkenborg keeps the score quality intact, as is the case with Skrein’s performance. But the movie is still a haphazardly conceived mess of poorly constructed, bizarrely acting individuals I’ve little to no connection to. So, a miss.

31. Ferrari. I don’t have a whole lot to say about it, other than the faux-Italian accents were a definite miss, and everything aside from the racing scenes and Penelope Cruz’s performance was just uninteresting. But Cruz and the races carried hard, plain and simple. Still, a mediocre movie that fails to examine its protagonist.

30. Mr. Holmes. It was an overall interesting take on an older Holmes, with Ian McKellen turning in a memorable performance as both versions of the character. To me the film did a good job juggling three separate plotlines, all of which had some merit. All in all, a graceful portrayal of an aged hero that lost most things and people he cared about. For some it’ll certainly be more graceful than the fates of Indiana Jones, Han Solo and Luke Skywalker.

29. The Boy and the Heron. Compared to how praised it was… I was disappointed. Maybe it was just me getting to know Miyazaki for the first time for real. But interestingly enough, I found very little interesting content in the movie other than the animation itself and the Grey Heron. I sure felt for Mahito, but I didn’t get to know him a whole lot in a substantial way. Nor any other character, really. They were like silhouettes, just passing through the screen, mere figures pushing Mahito to the next plot point. And his grand-grand-grand uncle? A complete afterthought. I don’t even know why he created that fantastical world, and a minute of WW2 carnage coupled with a few throwaway lines about the world’s “wickedness” a theme make not, sadly. But it’s still a good movie.

28. The Beekeeper. I had a good time, despite a plot light on thematics and character, but loaded with an absurd amount of bee metaphors. Adam, Jason Statham’s character, was reasonably grounded with both ruthlessness for capitalist scammers and care for ordinary citizens. Add some nice visuals, twists and supporting performances and you got a good, if overall run-of-the-mill action flick.

27. Scent of a Woman. Yeah, I like it. Most of it boils down to a fucking tour de force performance by Al Pacino and character work related to his character, but he just makes it work, especially with the “I’ll show you OUT OF ORDER!” scene. I won’t elaborate any further.

26. Insurrectionist 1863. For the first time we venture into Poland to see a historical movie telling the story of Father Stanisław Brzóska’s involvement in the January Uprising of 1863. The priest himself aside, the characters weren’t too compelling, but Brzóska’s journey throughout the movie, especially his role as a priest evolving in the conflict, makes it all worth it. This is a piece of cinema hard carried by the protagonist.

25. Screw Mickiewicz. Once more a Polish film which will (most likely) only hit for you if you’re from the country like myself. But it was a genuinely hilarious and lively flick, with a lot of actual understanding of the teenage Poles’ mentality and some fairly emotional moments. Also, a really nice soundtrack assembled from the works of modern Polish rap and pop artists.

24. The Iron Claw. Another overrated - if nearly actually great - darling of 2023. Like with Miyazaki’s piece, I felt little emotional connection to the Von Erich brothers, the most belonging to David - who died first. The amount of bad shit happening in succession was also too much; it felt like, dare I say, misery porn at times. No interesting cinematography (save for the black ‘n’ white opening) or music either. But the movie did present a compelling story looking at the plot elements themselves, and Fritz Von Erich was a very well-realized character.

23. May December. The first proper great movie of the bunch. Maybe some more time should have been spent on dissecting the relationship between Melton’s Joe and Moore’s Gracie, but since the protagonist is a sensationalist, self-important bitch that doesn’t care about the people she’ll be portraying, that’s what we get. Speaking of which, Natalie Portman made the movie for me, it was like a female Kirk Lazarus performance, absolutely stunning. Technical side of things wise it didn’t wow me, but its examination of the subject matter is absolutely commendable.

22. Sisu. Holy crap, what a great action flick. A bunch of decently despicable Nazis against an endlessly adaptable Finnish vet/hermit. Some nice team work between him and the enslaved women in the end, enthralling action and the pure grit make for a great offering. Again, see it in case you have not!

21. Alien: Romulus. I never hated Covenant (I just thought the ending with le bad guy David winning was stupid, which was understandable given the fact I was 14 back then and didn’t truly recognize the merit of bleaker closures in cinema), so I didn’t expect Romulus to be a “return to form”, but its upholding, which it was. Cailee Spaeny once again smashed the hell out of her role, nailing her more relaxed and tense scenes a like. She is also able to just… appear and act genuinely likeable, she makes for a rootable protagonist, y’know? Another standout is David Jonsson, playing an android like he was Paul Bettany or goddamn Michael Fassbender himself. Ian Holm’s undead appearance is irksome, sure, but they managed to disguise it well enough for me not to detect it until after I delved into the discourse. The horror of the aliens? On point. Atmosphere? Impeccable. Visuals? Breathtaking.

20. Rebel Ridge. This one is a milder offering spectacle and politics wise compared to the ones that come after it in the list, but it’s a worthy watch. The opener alone is a powerful one, and while perhaps not entirely accurate to how these things would go down, it gave me a good idea of the possible ways American cops abuse their authority, especially in regards to black people. And it’s consistently great throughout, especially with its execution of the non-killing protagonist.

19. Kiss The Girls. It’s an older one, but it checks out. I especially appreciate the sheer terror of the Casanova, both pre and post-reveal. Morgan Freeman, Cary Elwes and Ashley Judd all crushed their roles. But this won’t do the movie any justice… If you haven’t seen it for yourself, do it.

18. Furiosa. As far as prequels go, this one’s neat. Important info regarding the Mad Max world is there, coupled with brilliant performances by Anya Taylor-Joy (how the hell did she manage to emulate Charlize this well?! HOW?!) and Chris Hemsworth, who, channeling his inner Thor, puts a MadMaxesque spin on it, adding a layer of post-apocalyptic internal hollowness and insatiable, self-fueling cruelty and hatred, bred by some terrible trauma, not unlike Furiosa’s (or Thor’s, for that matter). I suppose that’s the main merit of the movie, the ways in which they mirror each other. Which makes their final scene together a fucking standout. Also, pay attention to the History Man: George Shevtsov is fantastic in the role, and occasionally he drops Thanos-level banger lines, adding both philosophical ideas and vulnerability to the story.

17. Joker: Folie à Deux. Likely the most controversial take, but I love this movie. It takes the well-known story from 2019, puts it in a new setting and makes the most of it. I was especially stoked once I realized the musical inserts were fantasies, extensions of Arthur and Harley’s desires, fears and wishes. The score provided a nice layer of gloominess to the whole, the cinematography was jaw-dropping, and I can’t help but find the conclusion… fitting. Like many others have said before me: it wasn’t about the Clown Prince of Crime. It was about a marginalized man who inadvertently became a symbol and an outlet for disillusioned citizens to embody their own fear and anger, only to be hated, rejected and forgotten once he declared he shared their fear and anger no longer. A beautiful deconstruction.

16. Scarborn. Another Polish film, but this time it’s a historical action flick. Centered around the Kościuszko Insurrection of 1794 it provides a pretty immersive piece of historical fiction centered around how said Insurrection came to be. Wait through the lengthy build up and the final act will wow you with Tarantino-esque tension and spectacle. Some fantastic cinematography, too!

15. Anora. This hurts me the most, because I believe it’s an impressive offering, but lacks “the sauce”. As great as Mikey Madison was as Anora, as believable as the world and characters around her were, I found insufficient amounts of context to care about her as much as Baker wanted me to. How fucking sad it is that I found TOROS, the main henchman character more interesting and entertaining to watch than her? Didn’t help that Baker couldn’t find the right tone for several scenes, especially the supposedly serious ones overloaded with comedic inserts… But his direction, especially the camera movement was without a doubt a true show of skill, and I cannot find any fault in the cinematography and non-lead performances either.

14. Wrooklyn Zoo. Yet another Polish movie in the mix, and most likely the most special one. It’s about Poland’s modern problems, the virtues and sins of the old and the youth and the absolutely amazing yet painful feeling that is love. While I don’t think our protagonists were amazing characters and the final act relies on a bit of resurrectionist Hollywood bullshit, the movie drips with style, heart and distinct energy that’s hard to put into words. Also, the pacing was fantastic. Made it seem like a movie of twice its length yet endlessly captivating.

13. Civil War. My introduction to Alex Garland, and what an introduction that was! My most favorite thing about it is just how hard it drills into the conflict between journalistic integrity and the pervasive sensationalist nature of the job, especially in America. Every single main character felt like a real person with their own ideas and priorities, everyone embodied their characters to a fault, and I could only watch with wonder and horror as their lives and jobs turned to shit due to the eponymous conflict. The final third is as captivating as it is devastating and can really make you think about the possibility of objective, well-intentioned documentation of tragedies.

12. The Holdovers. Maybe the most wholesome and hilarious thing I saw in 2024. Along the incredible, sharp performances by Paul Giamatti, Dominic Sessa and Da’Vine Joy Randolph wraps Alexander Payne’s whimsical yet touching screenplay. It’s a movie that understands the bitter, but at the same time shows them their current state of being doesn’t have to be what defines their life or gives it purpose.

11. Carry-On. I expected it to be a somewhat interesting execution of a promising premise. But man oh MAN, I was not prepared to witness the absolute CINEMA of it all, not at all! Everyone from Edgerton to Bateman is on their A game, the protagonist and the antagonists constantly outsmarting each other makes for an endlessly tense and riveting dynamic, and even the themes themselves present some interesting commentary about military subcontractors, arms deals and the boogeyman of Russian threat to America.

10. Poor Things. The VERY dodgy implications of what is being done to Bella and the unnecessary POV shift from the source material aside, this was a sublime introduction to Lanthimos. Whatever the scene called for, the man and his crew were more than up for the task. Tension, wonder, elation, terror, despair, hopelessness, cynicism, fulfillment, whimsy… all conveyed with a weirdness I suppose is uniquely his. Also, BRAVO to Jerskin Fendrix for that score. Bizarre yet utterly enthralling in how intrusive and odd it is. And to Emma Stone, who can like no other portray a determined, stoically wisecracking British woman.

9. The A(A)-Team. The final Polish offering. I did not expect to love it as much as I did. But when you get a bunch of terribly scarred yet well-meaning people trying to atone for what they did as alcoholics, a plot that combines the whackier sides of Poland and a very emotional main goal, with vibes and directorial style that keeps you glued to the screen no matter what, you get pretty good fucking cinema. My personal standouts are the little monochrome pencil-driven flashback animations that, combined with the protagonists’ voiceover, explain the mistakes they made and the pain they caused.

8. Priscilla. Cailee Spaeny should’ve been nominated for this, no doubt. She is as believable as her character at 14 as she is at 25. Her ability to transition between ages was just phenomenal. Make up team, Jacob Elordi and Sofia Coppola also deserve genuine praise. But my biggest praise for the film lies in the fact that it managed to make a great story without creating a narrative centered around a specific endeavor or event. It’s just a collection of connected events, yet each of them reveals something interesting about the characters or the world they inhabit.

7. Anatomy of a Fall. Probably the most down-to-earth film in the group. It leaves you with a lack of closure, a feeling of strong ambiguity and uncertainty. Which I suppose was the directorial intent. Great performances from everyone (though the one I’d nominate Sandra Hüller for was in Glazer’s, not Triet’s movie), a compelling mystery, and the courtroom scenes… Oh, they were a fucking blast. It was like watching a dead-serious, prosaic, more sincere version of Ace Attorney. Just as much entertainment and dynamism in the scenes, but without AA’s crazy energy. Best hallmarks of the movie’s quality are the fact I could only nitpick the slightly underwhelming cinematography and the grating 50 Cent track.

6. Speak No Evil. You’re probably surprised to see it up here, but I’mma own it. Not only does Speak No Evil use its vague premise to create a ticking bomb of a plot that once goes off, it fucking TEARS the screen to shreds. After that, it also becomes a fucking MASTERCLASS in tension, my whole body was there ready to give out any minute once our protagonists realized the deep shit they were in. Special accolades to James McAvoy, Mackenzie Davis and Scoot McNairy as far as performances go. There are also some well-conveyed themes about generational trauma poisoning people’s souls, the dangers of the inability to say “no” and the depths some will go to justify their actions. Fantastic filmmaking.

5. The Apprentice. I have to applaud Ali Abbasi for managing to keep the story infused with the typical Trumpian undertones of vanity, hedonism and rapaciousness and not losing the emotion in it. The movie forges the spear of depressive truths about Trump’s world and stabs you with it repeatedly. But eventually, the stab just hurts you somewhere lower, existentially. You don’t even feel for Donald anymore, if you ever did in the first place. All that’s left is Roy and Ivana, and they’re both royally screwed. As is America, if the final shot and real life are anything to go by. But hey, at least we got a three-composer-collaboration of a score that is both cohesive and fucking excellent in quality. How about that? (Nominate Dirkov, Holmes and Irvine for the Oscar, you COWARDS!)

4. Conclave. The one movie where my firm expectations regarding its quality were thoroughly fulfilled. When you look at it as a whole, you may come to a conclusion it’s like Oppenheimer, but in a church setting. I mean, I sure did get the impression, considering the sharp, visually clean and orderly directing/editing style, the rhythmically oppressive yet graceful score and the raw yet elegant acting of the performers involved. Fiennes earned his Best Actor nom, no doubt, but I’m secretly hoping for a Best Supporting nom for Carlos Diehz as Vincent Benítez. He sold the man’s honesty, kindness and timidness with such conviction I only doubted it due to a fakeout Berger planted last minute. As far as their characters’ innocence goes, this year only Cailee Spaeny matched Diehz. The movie plays like a purebred conspiracy thriller, questioning everyone’s motives, infusing paranoia and uncertainty into every scene. You have ZERO fucking confusion about the extent to which the Holy See lost its way, because certain frames just scream “This can’t be made right, can IT?!” But the movie’s true genius lies in its twist, because it reframes both the movie’s themes and characters in ways never explicitly stated, yet hard-hitting once inferred. This would’ve been a masterpiece had the secondary antagonist been more fleshed out.

3. Dune Part 2. Denis Villeneuve and Greg Fraser ain’t skipped a single goddamn beat on the production. Hans Zimmer did, but even with more repetition his musical material is top-notch. The movie sure takes a while to get going, but I have nothing but applause for it for how effectively it establishes its antagonist (really crappy how they did very little with him in the end, though), and how the Harkonnenian clusterfuck on Arrakis beautifully falls apart with time. When Paul ascends to Prophet level and goes sicko mode on the establishment, the movie kicks into its highest gear on all levels. We understand everyone’s position in the conflict and what they’re willing to do to achieve their goals. Which makes it so frustrating Emperor Shaddam and Feyd-Rautha do not get nearly enough time to have their political and philosophical perspectives be expressed. But still, the movie is lethally efficient when it comes to… Chani and her disillusionment arc. Not only is she an excellent mirror to the bloodthirsty Gurney and the increasingly fanatical Stilgar, Zendaya turns in some incredibly believable acting that had me rooting for her with no questions. I can’t wait for Messiah, and Shai-Hulud bless Villeneuve’s team!

2. The Zone of Interest. That movie hits on a deeper level. I did not actually comprehend what I saw until I was back home from the theater, and that’s when I started crying. The movie is indeed viciously effective in how much it can tear your heart out without you seeing or realizing it in the first place. Insanely beautiful cinematography, and the score… 3 tracks in the whole movie, yet they’re all fucking Oscar-worthy. Great acting. And the theme of invisibility… it’s clear enough you know what’s the context Glazer applies it to, but also subtle enough everyone will have ideas about what it means to say and which other contexts it can be applied to in real life. Probably the best candidate for 2023’s BP barring Oppenheimer.

1. The Substance. If The Zone of Interest is bold, then Coralie Fargeat’s project is BOLD. Not really in its theme, but in how it’s executed. It’s an attack on the senses, in both a good and bad way. The screen sucks you in and shits you out time and time again. You’re in an abusive relationship with it, just like Liz Sparkle is with The Substance/Sue. Huge props for the trailer, because it fooled me so hard into thinking we’d be getting an individual v individuals/society conflict, while we got an individual v self conflict. I was watching with all my interest as Liz and Sue tried to undermine each other yet being constantly forced to rely on one another, as the situation got worse and worse. It’s not that a person is trying to destroy themself, it’s how extreme the degradation is. The movie knows no fucking restraint sometimes, and in those times the terror can be mixed with perverse glee and karmic satisfaction, gives those times coincide with character punishment, but when it manages to show restraint, the horror stings more profoundly. In 2024 few things in cinema managed to scare the crap out of me, and one of them was Sue smiling hysterically to a mirror as several of her teeth were falling out. The Substance thrives in the hateful and the loving, the gross and the tantalizing, the sinister and the kind. At its heart it’s a story of a woman who could not forgive herself for something she had no control over. You really see it in 3 scenes only, but those 3 scenes are what’s enough to make the movie sincere. Moore and Qualley are insanely convincing. God! Just give it the BP already!



All in all, a great year. I won’t say it’s superior to 2023 or anything, but I think I’d rate The Substance on the same level as Babylon (a delayee from 2022 that topped the 2023 chart), which I suppose is saying something. But now I know one thing for sure. Cinema has become something I’ll probably love forever."	/r/TrueFilm/comments/1hrztwh/looking_back_on_2024_a_cinematic_year_in_review/	https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/1hrztwh/looking_back_on_2024_a_cinematic_year_in_review/

Off the top of my head I’d say numbers, “Franchise: Subtitle”, and Indiana Jones/Harry Potter’s “…and the…” aren’t unique. There are probably plenty of questionable ones though…. The Matrix is “franchise: subtitle” but they’ve all got “Re-“ in them, for example. The Vacations are all different, well, vacations, but they don’t feel unique to me bc they all just state the premise. If your pick is borderline include the rationale in your argument if you’d like lmao.

I’m gonna go with Linklater’s Before Sunrise, Before Sunset, and Before Midnight. An incredible romance that you probably approach differently as you age, just as the characters do, and which leaves you questioning your idea of love at every turn.

indiana_jones	movies	1h8ongk	1733562310	Saturday silliness: Combine two or more different movie titles and describe the plot	"For example:

**""Raiders of the Lost Boys""** - While seeking the Ark of the Covenant, Indiana Jones crosses paths with a group of teenage delinquents that turn out to be an ancient vampire cult. Indiana must race to prevent the vampires from obtaining the Ark, which they plan to use as a weapon to amplify their power, while also uncovering a mysterious connection between the ancient artifact and the vampires' immortality.

**""Deadpool &amp; Amelie""** - Wade Wilson meets his match when he encounters Amelie, a quirky and imaginative French woman with the ability to manipulate those around her in whimsical ways. Wade's chaotic life as a fourth wall-breaking, crime-fighting, mutant vigilante is at odds with Amelie's more innocent, heartfelt, and compassionate approach to life, and their differences slowly transform both individuals in ways that will change them forever. 

**""Paddington vs. Predator""** - A loveable young anthropomorphic bear returns to the Peruvian jungle that was once his home, where a deadly alien Predator also happens to be hunting. Fortunately for Paddington, his kindness and resourcefulness allow him to befriend other animals that help him outwit the Predator’s traps. The Predator becomes increasingly frustrated, leading to even more dangerous encounters, but Paddington manages to turn the tables in a film full of adorable humor and action-packed tension.

indiana_jones	movies	1h0bbt0	1732626109	Movie franchise titles that made sense for the first installment, but not for subsequent films	"When a movie gets a sequel, the studio wants audiences to know that it's a sequel to a popular film, so they'll make sure to include the title or part of the title of the original film and add something to it, like ""Title 2"", ""Title II"", ""Title Part 2"", ""Title: The Revenge"", ""Tit2e"", etc.

This can sometimes be weird when the title of the original film was very specific to the events of the original film but doesn't really apply to the plot or characters of later installments. For example, Friday the 13th made sense as a title because the events took place on a Friday the 13th. However, many of the sequels explicitly do not take place on a Friday the 13th, especially the third and fourth movies which take place in the days right after the 2nd movie. Another example is how the Karate Kid title made sense for the original and its sequels, but didn't really make sense for the Jackie Chan remake because it was about Kung-Fu and not Karate.

Sometimes the studios are aware of this and will just change the title of the franchise to something more recognizable. The first Indiana Jones movie was called ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"", a title that wouldn't work for sequels because the Ark of the Covenant had been dealt with. As such, it was decided to just rename the franchise after the main character Indiana Jones, and the first movie retroactively became ""Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark"". Same with First Blood retroactively becoming Rambo: First Blood once the franchise became Rambo.

So what other movie franchises have names that don't make sense in later installments, or had their names changed to something different from the title of the original installment?"	/r/movies/comments/1h0bbt0/movie_franchise_titles_that_made_sense_for_the/	https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h0bbt0/movie_franchise_titles_that_made_sense_for_the/

Dances with Wolves is a better movie than Goodfellas and deserved to win Best Picture

Pearl Harbour is actually a really good movie. I thought it was cheesy and lame when it came out but it actually one of my favourites now. 

Dunkirk and Oppenheimer are the only Christopher Nolan movies I like, and I actually hate Interstellar. 

Hook is not actually a good movie. We liked it as kids and we rewatch it for pure nostalgia. 

Die Hard 2, Die Hard with a Vengeance and the uncut version of Live Free or Die Hard are all better than Die Hard. 

Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom is the only worthwhile Indiana Jones movie worth revisiting on the regular.

Aside from the opening act, Harrison Ford was phoning it in. The performances were mediocre, the dialogue/script was lazy and immature (Ray Winstone had the worst lines and stupidest character development).

Karen Allen came back and they didn't do anything with her, except just be along for the ride. Her spunk and personality is nowhere to be seen, her biggest scene is her crying about being left at the Wedding chappel (they essentially made her into Willie Scott).

Shia LaBoeuf's Mutt Williams is meant to be a take on Marlon Brando in ""The Wild One"" so he wears a leather jacket and keeps combing his dye cut. How groundbreaking. He also leads a inexplicable scene where he and a chimpanzee have a smiling game and he suddenly turns into Mowgli from ""The Jungle Book"".

Cate Blanchett is wasted as the token Nazi/Soviet Agent, sounding like Natasha from The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show, completely forgettable and generic.

The special effects are awfuil, the CGI obvious and distracting, like the waterfall sequence or the car chase scene. I couldn't find the kind of wonder the previous films offered.

It's a bad, bad film. It isn't the first Steven Spielberg film I found to be below average yet every single one was professionally made and had some distinguishing factors (I didn't like ""Hook"" yet I loved the Maggie Smith scenes). ""Indiana Jones and The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" was bad in every step of the way.

indiana_jones	movies	1ev1sxd	1723959040	Is it feasible to screen old movies on film any more?	"Forgive me if this is the wrong place, I found a few threads on the cost to screen a movie, but nothing about the actual film.

I live in Upstate NY where there's a pretty decent independent theater scene and I have access to NYC and the IFC Center, but I've seen relatively few movies even being advertised as screened on film. I saw The Hateful Eight on 70mm and it was pretty rough (My local AMC didn't really know what they're doing), and I don't think I've ever seen classic movies being shown near me. I know film degrades over time and studios keep the prints pretty heavily guarded for remasters, but you'd think gigantic movies like Star Wars or Indiana Jones would have so many reels distributed that they'd be floating around for reasonable prices, like how old video game cartridges are cheaper if they were printed like crazy. Maybe it's more of a thing in and around LA?

It's heartbreaking to think that I was the last generation that could go to the theater and see a print of a movie almost exactly the way it was filmed, great remasters are few and far in between, and even those aren't perfect. I run a restaurant and the dream is to screen movies on film (dumb garbage or the first half of Jaws, whatever) for a late bar crowd, but the more I look into it, the more it seems that it isn't realistic even for a major theater."	/r/movies/comments/1ev1sxd/is_it_feasible_to_screen_old_movies_on_film_any/	https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1ev1sxd/is_it_feasible_to_screen_old_movies_on_film_any/

I've been wanting to catch up on some classics, and as a big fan of things like Uncharted and Tomb Raider also, been really keen to finally delve into the Indiana Jones movies more as well!

I've also heard some people really enjoyed the 3rd movie - The Last Crusade, so definitely excited to see that as well!

Love the setting in Temple of Doom! And from memory of the first movie, I feel like this really ramped up with how much more action-packed it was, and how many more regular surprises there were. This was definitely quite the ride! (Quite literally, as towards the end as well)

One memorable scene was also the stunt section of when they were escaping the mines and Indiana was flying on the hook in parallel to the cart below. Could imagine how that must've been live on set. Filmed in live time with the contraptions and all! 😋

Think I picked up another Wilhelm scream in there as well haha.

And oh man, any time I hear that original theme song - it's so fantastic. So powerful and brilliant! Similar feelings I get when listening to the Uncharted (game) themes as well (can imagine it probably had some inspiration as well perhaps 😋 haha)

Then based on the low reviews for the Dial of Destiny, it didn’t help that the movie was a huge flop not only critically when it came out, but fans of the series also trashed it at the time of its release.




So my point is that I don’t understand what makes it so difficult for the franchise to be able to thrive in a modern era for cinema as the original trilogy still gets high praise, yet what again I don’t understand is why the newer ones end up missing the mark, like what the directors in charge of the franchise keep doing wrong."	/r/flicks/comments/1ee14oy/what_exactly_ruined_indiana_jones/	https://www.reddit.com/r/flicks/comments/1ee14oy/what_exactly_ruined_indiana_jones/

The first Spider-Man movie?LOTR Fellowship &amp; Two Towers? The Matrix Reloaded? War of the Worlds? But now? Yikes	"What happened to movie trailer music? Certain movie trailers had music that would just get you so pumped up. You wanted to charge head first into battle wielding a flaming sword!

Now you kinda just shrug.


Kids today just have zero idea of what it was like to see the original Spider-Man trailer(not the teaser), the one that started with the Matrix theme and ended with a kick ass E.S Prometheus track after the line “Who am I? I’m Spider-Man!” Then we get that terrific DuN nun nun dun dun dun uh nun nun music. Holy shit! Sure it showed almost the whole movie but I didn’t care because…that music!

Or Fellowship of the Ring when it used the song Gothic Power? (Which War of the Worlds 2005 would use). Epic! Just pure epic ness.

Probably the most infamous of these was the Requiem for a Dream remix used during LOTR Two Towers. “There will be no Dawn for men” I can still close my eyes and visualize seeing that trailer in a theatre. Everyone gripped their seat tight and held on for dear life. Finally rugged ass Aargorn opened those big ass wooden Rohan doors in slo mo? “An army built for a single purpose. To destroy the world of men”

How about using an Intrumental of Rob Dougan’s “I’m not Driving Anymore” for Matrix Reloaded. Perfect! “What happens if I fail?” “Then Zion will fall”. I can hear the dialogue with the music clear as day.


I think it started to change when The Social Network trailer hit. Using that amazing cover of Radio Heads creep. That and the Inception Bwaaaap started to make things more “song” and sound effect related than orchestral epic ness.

Now it’s comes to the point where a movie like Gladiator 2 uses a Jay Z song because the word “Colosseum” is uttered. You felt the trailer just die a slow death at that point. What? Is this because Denzel is in it? Why are they using a rap song in a trailer for GLADIATOR 2!

Or a movie like Indiana Jones 5 using a Rolling Stone song in its trailer What? Why? Then it ends with a weak synth version of Indy’s March? What were they thinking?

indiana_jones	movies	1d0jnz3	1716665646	Dial of Destiny is easily the worst of the Indiana Jones franchise for me	"(Side note, I know this movie came out last summer but I am just barely choosing to post my thoughts on it now)

I know I'm in the minority with this, but I really wasn't impressed with Dial of Destiny. I just found it to be incredibly bland and forgettable with a few very bad decisions. For better or for worse, Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is at least super memorable due to the big swings it takes and fresh new ideas it explores in the franchise. That's always a movie I've felt got way too much hate even before 5 came out. While Kingdom was a step down from the trilogy, it has great action sequences, good new characters blended with the old, a cool macguffin, Harrison Ford is still giving it his all, the connection of the 1950's with Russians and Aliens is brilliant, it gives Indy a happy and proper ending, and best of all, it still has the Spielberg magic which made the first four great. Some bad CGI and a few stupid moments aren't enough to ruin that movie for me.

Dial of Destiny on the other hand.... had some fine action scenes, a cool reveal in the third act, good CGI, and a totally servicable plot. That being said though, I didn't care for any of the side characters, the villain was the most forgettable in the series by a long shot, Indy does nothing in the movie, Ford is phoning it in, Helena was insufferable, they end up doing nothing with the third act reveal, the story dragged and then suddenly rushed towards the end, and there didn't feel like there were any stakes. Worst of all, Indy being belittled constantly and being made to be a lonely, washed up, failed old man was just awful. Sure you can argue that's supposed to be the start of his arc, but he doesn't even do anything in the rest of the movie. He's basically forced on the mission with his goddaughter and some random kid who treat him bad. Also I need to mention that very few of the old characters returning from the previous 4 (except for cameos) was a missed opportunity. And the ending of having him reunite with Marion was their attempt at making a ""happy ending"" for him, but he already got that at the end of 4. Only in that movie, he was surrounded by friends, loved ones, had a good stable career, wasn't soon to be arrested, and had his son. Why did they kill off Mutt by the way, why not just recast him? That character from 4 would NEVER join the war either. And as I mentioned, the Spielberg magic was completely missing from here. Everyone loves to praise the opening sequence in Dial, but to me, it just felt like a cheap attempt to imitate a better director and a better set of movies that we already got decades ago.

Damn, I had way more to say of Dial of Destiny than I thought. Anyway, it has almost been a year since I saw it in theaters, so maybe it's due for a rewatch, but I just don't feel like doing so due to how flat it felt for me.

# DAY 1: Nominations!

# Nominate someone who you think is the UMB. Someone else must second the nomination for it to count. To make it fair, NO Superheroes or anyone with powers; just humans. I'm thinking we go for a Top 25, so we need 25 nominations (of course if this takes off, we could do more). Remember, a name must be seconded to be added to the list, so if someone else posts a name you think should be on the list, just go ahead and reply to it with ""Seconded!"" or something. Once we have 25 seconded nominations, I'll make the list, and each day we'll vote on who should be eliminated (meaning put on the bottom spot). Voting continues until we have a complete 1-25 ranking!

Here are a few names to get us started. Anyone on this list you think deserves to be considered - just second it!

Blondie (Man with No Name) – ***Dollars trilogy***

indiana_jones	movies	1c0ibh4	1712744905	What is this movie?	I remember one watching a film about a Nazi armoured train hidden within a mountain in a desert. At one point a hidden entrance opened up and the train would go. It was similar to an Indiana Jones film. It was also in colour. That’s about as much information I can provide.

indiana_jones	movies	1bw4ybw	1712279454	Has a movie ever helped change your opinion of another movie?	"Indiana Jones and the Dial Of Destiny gave me a new appreciation for Kingdom of the Crystal Skull last summer. Halfway through I had the idea that I was a little hard on KOTCS and would rather watch that, I have rewatched the 4th entry twice since then and I do have a much higher respect for it.

The higher respect being that it is no longer the worst one, but I do appreciate the pacing,  side characters and chase scenes a lot more than in Dial Of Destiny.

I should have seen it coming since Disney Lucasfilm caused a similar revision to the prequels, I never disliked them in the first place (Clone Wars generation) so for me there wasn't really a switch that flipped in my head like with Indiana Jones.

For all the franchise movies I've seen I can't think of another instance where my opinion changed so drastically as I was watching something else.

1. Golden Idol of Fertility- 5/5 problematic, idol was obviously supposed to stay where it was. Belloq was working with the indigenous peoples and understood the idols importance to them, Indy was definitely the bad guy.

2. Ark of the covenant- 2/5 it’s 1936 and this is done at the request of the army. Should have consulted Jewish scholars, but at least Indy knew not to look at the opened Ark. If this was after the formation of Israel, should have returned it to them promptly.

3. Remains of Emperor Nurhachi - 5/5, grave robbing for organized crime, obviously terrible.

4. Indian village sacred stones - 1/5 problematic, Indy found this situation by accident and promptly returned the stones to the village. I held back from a 0 score since he didn’t get a more specific name than “sacred stones.”

5. Cross of Coronado: 2/5. Again, young Indiana seems to stumble into the situation. Adult Indiana clearly just wants to add to the museum collection and dismisses any notion of the cross going elsewhere with ""Coronado is dead and so are all his grandchildren"".

6. Holy Grail: 0/5, Indiana’s motivations in the movie are almost entirely to save his dad, not collect the item. He gains understanding with the Brotherhood of the Cruciform Sword and ultimately leaves the grail where it is.

7. Skull in US: 0/5, storm Area 51 anytime.

8. Skulls in Peru: 5/5, There’s an organized guard trying to protect the area, let them do their job. 

9. Antikythera: 5/5 “Oh this Greek artifact?

indiana_jones	movies	1axj0oc	1708639052	What was so wrong with Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull?	"A lot of what I’ve seen regarding this movie is overwhelmingly negative, but I can’t figure out why.

Is it because of aliens? If that’s the case, I think that’s stupid. In the other movies he deals with literal supernatural artifacts that have their own “unexplainable” powers. Why is a crystal skull of an extra-dimensional being so far fetched? 

Is it because of Shia LeBouf? Sure, he was handed the keys to the kingdom and proceeded to flush it all down the drain regarding the continuation of things, but that shouldn’t affect the film. 

Is it the Soviets? Two of the other films literally had Nazi’s in pursuit of paranormal/supernatural weapons. 

To me, it hit all the right notes of an Indiana Jones film. Truth be told, I like it way better than the Temple of Doom. And perhaps that’s an intolerable conclusion. But if so, I’m going to need someone to explain it to me. 

Edit: Wow, so the effects really turned off so many of you? I don’t know about others, but when I watch movies, there’s a level of suspension of disbelief I have that makes even the worse CGI more enjoyable."	/r/movies/comments/1axj0oc/what_was_so_wrong_with_indiana_jones_and_the/	https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1axj0oc/what_was_so_wrong_with_indiana_jones_and_the/

Entire Generations Have Missed out on Original Star Wars Trilogy, Jaws, Indiana Jones, Ghostbusters, LOTR, The Matrix etc The Way they were Meant to be Seen. I’m not talking Fathom events either. Major wide releases with marketing!	"The theatrical business seems to be slowly dying. Studios like Disney have a potential answer right there in their vaults but for some reason they don’t do anything with them. Back in the day releasing a movie use to cost MAJOR money. You’d have to print reels of films &amp; ship them. Now? It’s mostly digital and much cheaper.

Re-releases use to be common place before home video. All the classics would get Re released every 5-10 years. Now the only time it seems to happen is with rinky dink “fathom events” screenings which get barely any marketing and are limited to a single day or weekend

Studios like Disney need to start doing MAJOR, WIDE re-releases with marketing actual campaigns. Spend some $$. 


How many people have never seen the original Star Wars trilogy the way it was meant to be seen? The Special Edition Re release back in 1997 was HUGE. Why? Because an entire generation had grown up seeing the movies at home &amp; wanted to A) See the movies how they weren’t meant to be seen and B) see it with an audience and C) check out the new scenes and FX. 

See studios think because we now have 65 inch widescreen 4K TV’s that the experience at home is enough. But that’s not why people go to the movies. We go to the movies, a lot of us, to experience something with an audience. You ever see a comedy in a theatre, laughed your ass off, watched it again at home and had a completely different reaction? That’s the magic of the theatre baby!

And it’s all pretty much found money. The movies have already been paid for. Plus it gives a life line to struggling theatres. There is almost no down side and yet it rarely happens and if it does it like a 1 night only thing.

Disney especially has a major library of classics just waiting to be seen on the big screen. Maybe they are afraid it’ll hurt the streaming business. If so, that’s idiotic."	/r/movies/comments/1ar20n8/studios_need_to_start_releasing_classic_movies_in/	https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1ar20n8/studios_need_to_start_releasing_classic_movies_in/

Main reason I was not excited was because I thought Indie was done in the last film, he seemed to have found happiness.

So anyways the movie is not bad and I have to say the de-aging was well done. Actors did a great job I have no complaints, story is a little wacky but it's Indiana Jones. Film looked great, great scenery and sets no complaints.

What I was not ready for was the ending scene, yeah I had tears in my eyes, that one scene made the movie for me. 5 movies, I think that's a good number, I truly think this is the last Jones movie at least with Harrison Ford in it.

Hell of a run, good ride."	/r/movies/comments/1aimroe/ijw_indiana_jones_and_the_dial_of_destiny/	https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1aimroe/ijw_indiana_jones_and_the_dial_of_destiny/
indiana_jones	flicks	18vdaem	1704045780	A Very Long, Detailed Ranking of (Almost) Every Movie I Watched in 2023	"29. Extraction 2 - God, what a waste of time. Hardly any character was compelling, the movie scared with its visual blandness, action itself underwhelmed. One of the characters’ death scene was so overdone I laughed. Now, mind you, I almost NEVER laugh at death in movies, so that should give you an example of how mediocre this shit was.   
28. Pan Samochodzik i Templariusze/Mr. Car and the Knights Templar - this is the first non-American movie and the first Polish one. Brace yourselves, you’re going to see quite a few of these. In short, the movie is fairly insulting to the original books, does nothing with the semi-interesting reinterpretation of the character, provides some very clunky characterization and semi-decent action. I’d say its most redeeming quality is the fact that its nonsensical execution made for hilarious comedy sometimes.  
27. Knights of the Zodiac - this finally had proper visuals, but the plot was more confusing. The inciting incident itself doesn’t make sense! Why does Athena, the goddess of wisdom and “just” war possess a random girl and intend to destroy the world? Well, you will never know because fuck the audience. It’s amazing how lacking almost everything is and how utterly formulaic the movie is at times. Didn’t help that the bigger caliber actors were wasted.  
26. Akademia Pana Kleksa/Kleks Academy - the first non-American movie. A valiant if lacking effort to revive the world and characters of a classic Polish book for children. Overall, I’d say this is something between a remake, a reboot, a sequel and a prequel to the original book. So we already have a mess. The pacing is very uneven, the acting kind of works, the scenery and visuals kind of slay occasionally, overall the technical execution does a lot of heavy lifting. But the heavy-handed themes (even if praiseworthy in concept) and very clunky dialogue combined with questionable editing brings this down quite a bit.  
25. The Marvels - another very confused movie that wastes most of its prominent characters. I feel very sorry for Brie Larson and Zawe Ashton, they deserved a better movie. A longer, darker one. I would also feel sorry for Iman Vellani, but she slayed and her character, Kamala Khan, was actually written engagingly and consistently. The visuals provide some nice views from time to time, there is overall creativity and a vision to all this, but it all feels too disjointed, rushed, undercooked. The result is a film with some heart, comedic beats and spectacle that will somewhat keep your attention. But nothing more.  
24. Creed III - Maybe it was my mistake to go for this without watching the two previous movies, but I digress. The movie is overall well executed, has some nice tension, I like Donnie and Dame as characters, but I just… don’t have a whole lot to say about it. It’s a nicely done, inoffensive, a little bland, but fine movie.  
23. You People - contrary to almost everyone around, I like this movie. I found Ezra and Amara’s relationship believable, Julia Louis Dreyfus and Eddie Murphy did well as the oppositely annoying parents to each of the protagonists, the humor had me laughing heartily at times and the movie even drops some truth bombs at times.  
22. Mafia Mamma - a surprisingly well-realized fish-out-of-water comedy. Toni Collette fit the main character like a glove, she works amazing as this super driven yet frantic woman who was pulled into murky mafia shit. The supporting characters and antagonists are likeable, interesting and well motivated. The movie doesn’t do much blunders, it’s not really great but it works fine for what it sets out to achieve.  
21. R.M.N./Electromagnetic Resonance - this time we dip our fingers in Eastern Europe, Romania specifically. The acclaimed director Cristian Mungiu sets forth a very atmospheric and engrossing piece of political/social commentary that succeeds for the most part. Most, because the protagonist is almost completely disconnected from the drama of two Asian immigrants trying to work and acclimate to a remote Romanian village. The movie sometimes lost its focus, but when it had it, it worked wonders in its uncompromising desire to examine modern Romanian society.  
20. Kryptonim Polska/Codename Poland - the penultimate motion picture from my homeland in this ranking. Gotta say, I did not expect this movie to be as good as it was. It’s a pretty straightforward if insanely biting piece of political satire. Shit had me HOLLERING with laughter at how well it ridiculed the stupid crap we Poles pull these days. The characters were well realized, and I especially appreciate the antagonists effortlessly switching between comedic mooks to actual intimidating nationalists. The movie overall succeeds in broad tone shifts.   
19. Beau Is Afraid - while I believe Ari Aster had every right to put everything he did in the movie, sometimes he just overdid it. The craziness was well-presented, but sometimes the film just behaved insane for the sake of it. A balls-tripping adventure is very cool but can sometimes get nauseating and overdone. Still, the movie engrossed me with its striking aesthetics, delightfully unhinged characters and some deep themes. I just wish he didn’t turn &gt;!Mona, Beau’s mom and!&lt; the movie’s main antagonist, into a mouthpiece that spelled everything out in a damn monologue. The ending, however? Shit was right up my alley. It was subtle enough to not look on the nose but explicit enough to be immediately understandable. It felt grim, but was also a supremely fitting conclusion to the movie and Beau himself.  
17. The Flash - this movie somehow manages to be more insane than BIA. And yet it overall is somewhat better. I was initially harsh on the score, but it grew on me with time and I can safely say Benjamin Wallfisch did a good job. The acting slays, Ezra Miller, his behavior notwithstanding, is Barry Allen to me, maybe as much as Grant Gustin. EM portrayed both Barry 1 and 2 perfectly, Ben Affleck put in a very good if brief performance as DCEU Batman, everyone else did fine as well. Barry 2 is a fantastic character that you root for, get annoyed by and feel sorry for, experiencing believable growth and development in a super engaging way. The effects somewhat suck balls, but the overall cinematography and direction make up for it. However, the movie FLOUNDERS hard in the 3rd act and it's due to it that I cannot call the Flash anything more than good.  
16. The Killer - a very well paced and elegantly executed thriller from David Fincher. Fun cinematography, another compelling performance from Fassbender. Also liked the themes of the movie and the protagonist’s arc. Overall, a movie with somewhat high highs and kinda low lows.   
15. John Wick: Chapter 4 - as emotionally flat as this movie is, I really like it. The visuals are insane for a simple hitman movie, the action, even if self-indulgent, is overall top notch, the actors give it their all and the pacing maintains a steady flow that makes for an enjoyable watching experience. Maybe if the screenplay was more thematically and emotionally loaded I’d crank it up a bit…  
14. Luther: The Fallen Sun - surprised me, because certain parts of the beginning jarred me. However, the movie soon turned into a high-octane but restrained and somewhat grounded thriller that plays with some timely themes. All Andy Serkis, Idris Elba and Cynthia Erivo give great performances, with the shoutout to the latter, she did great in the 3rd act especially. Lorne Balfe goes INSANE with a score that manages to be inspiring, tense, menacing and soulful. Shit is crazy underrated. The action in this movie was also very well executed.  
13. Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny - the first great movie on the list. Somehow, bringing back the familiar elements from the previous Indy films did not feel jarring, but rather in-place. I felt Helena was rather charismatic and properly developed as a character, the spin Mangold put here on the Nazis provides a very fresh angle that I really enjoyed, the action doesn’t lose the old Spielbergian energy and liveliness and the last 10 minutes are just beautiful. The conclusion to Indiana Jones and Harrison Ford’s tenure in the role touched me deeply. I personally believe this is the best conclusion an old Indy could have gotten.  
12. The Pale Blue Eye - This rather slow burn of a movie stuns with fascinating shots of a wintery New York and some rather immaculate acting. The final payoff with Bale’s character, August Landor, makes for a supremely rewarding ending, if incredibly dark. I also enjoyed Harry Melling’s portrayal of Edgar Allan Poe and the semi-psychedelic vibe maintained throughout the plot.  
11. El Puño del Cóndor/The Fist of the Condor - a surprisingly well-made Chilean martial arts film. Marko Zaror shines as the actor playing the lead and the antagonist, as well as the combat choreographer behind the fight scenes. Ernesto Espinoza, the writer-director of the film, presents an atmospheric and energetic 80 minute flick which combines high-octane Latino martial arts with spiritual themes, leading to a resolution with the Hoist By His Own Petard trope. While a fine trope in of itself, it is cranked up to awesome levels by the INSANE execution of it as writing, juxtaposition and cinematography combine to create a moment of pure filmmaking magic. Definite recommendation!  
10. The In-Laws/Teściowie - the final Polish film on the list. I expected a semi-serious comedy in a confined setting, what I got was an absurdly captivating escalation drama. Accompanied, I should add, by inspired performances from the 4 lead actors, incredibly atmospheric cinematography and a string of mysteries and reveals that kept me engaged and thrilled. Very strong writing, especially with the ending twist.  
9. Maestro - this is the highest ranked movie I have mixed feelings about. Sometimes, it lacks focus, is incredibly on-the-nose and kinda beats about the bush. But most of the time it gives a compelling insight into the relationship of Leonard Bernstein and Felicia Montealegre. Cooper and Mulligan both shine as the leads, and their performances improve as their characters age. The displays of Bernstein’s musical skills, as sparse as they were, felt incredibly telling and impactful. The camera went CRAZY, Matthew Libatique deserves an Oscar nom for the almost painting-like visual look he crafted with Cooper for the movie. And Bernstein’s music befitted the overall pic utterly. This is a case of very high highs outmatching low lows.  
8. Napoleon - screw the critics, this movie won me over. I was kind of waiting for it, hoping Ridley Scott would be unapologetic in his portrayal of the emperor. And he was. Napoleon was portrayed as such a vainglorious shitheel, I could not believe my eyes. I was utterly giddy at how the movie effortlessly switched between satire and drama while still remembering to get me to care for the two leads. Great performances by Phoenix and Kirby. FANTASTIC direction and photography for the battles of Toulon and Austerlitz. Impressive score by Martin Phipps. Wow!  
7. BlackBerry - a movie about phones and the communication market, boring? You’d think so, but this one is actually sort of a tour de force. Stylized with retro aesthetics, brimming with unmistakable energy and personality, BlackBerry takes us on a captivating journey of the titular phone and the people who made it, their rise and their fall. Glenn Howerton and Jay Baruchel shine as the two leads, Jim Balsille and Mike Lazaridis, whose relationship reminded me of RDJ and Cillian Murphy as Lewis Strauss and Julius Robert Oppenheimer. Except this is kind of a different spin, and here, one of the protagonists becomes like the other over time, instead of becoming their opposite. It’s very engaging to watch. But the highest praise is reserved for Matt Johnson, director, screenwriter and main supporting actor of the film, who realized a tense yet comedic experience that brilliantly showcases the chaotic and unforgiving landscape of big business.  
6. Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes - I had moderate expectations for this one, and shit man, it surpassed them with flying colors! Strong performances all around, with special shoutouts to the two leads playing characters that can’t be easily put into boxes and the gloriously hammy Viola Davis. The movie shines through its atmosphere that sucks you in and themes which infuse the conflict with meaning and make you care about the characters’ fate. Overall, a success on almost all fronts.  
5. Pamfir - No Country For Old Men in Ukraine. However, let me be bold and say this is supremely better than the disappointing NCFOM. While it mirrors the Coens’ movie in showcasing the dissatisfaction and futility of life, it doesn’t spit in my face for being invested in the main characters. The leads are also very human and likeable, and the lack of music somehow works. But Pamfir’s biggest strength is its goddamn visual panache. It’s shot in a very believable and naturalistic yet riveting manner. It makes excellent use of natural scenery and light, showcasing the beauty of Ukraine and coming off as stylized enough to provide a greatly immersive experience.  
4. Barbie - a simple, but very thematically interesting and entertaining exercise in social satire. Love its use of montages and visual storytelling, love the themes behind the movie and the performances of the actors. Ken is a goddamn outstanding character, and Ryan Gosling 100% deserves his Oscar nom. The music is also wicked good when it comes to it, and the movie overall gave me a fun and creative experience that also made me think of certain things.  
3. Oppenheimer - Christopher Nolan just don’t miss, man. He don’t miss at all. Oppenheimer is a fascinating, staggering watch that combines multiple time periods with grace and panache, weaving them together into a compelling character study. Murphy’s Oppenheimer and RDJ’s Strauss are some of the best characters of the decade, and I was more than enthralled by their methodical, gradual evolution over time. Ludwig Goransson puts forward masterful soundtrack pieces as if it was just another Thursday for him, Hoyte Van Hoytema stuns with detailed and crisp yet stylized cinematography, and Jennifer Lame keeps the movie’s pace and energy intact in the editing. This movie is exactly the biopic we need and deserve. The piece de resistance of 2023 cinema.  
2. Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 - James Gunn’s magnum opus. It was moving, hilarious, tense, fun and grandiose. Despite the plot being fairly straightforward, this movie is anything but simple, as it carefully concludes the development of several recurring characters and brings us a fantastic villain in the flesh of the High Evolutionary. John Murphy proves a worthy replacement for Tyler Bates as the main composer, Henry Braham creates visuals that wow despite the muted colors and I don’t even have to say anything about the outstanding practical effects/makeup/prosthetics work, do I? Also, Rocket Raccoon, who is undoubtedly one of the best and most fleshed out characters in the MCU.  
1. Babylon - what an unbelievably outstanding piece of CINEMA. Jesus. Not only does it have three fully developed leads that I all cared for and rooted for, a supporting cast that can both amuse and move you but also a visual layer that is a goddamn moving painting. With just this movie, Linus Sandgren rose above almost any Hollywood cinematographer. The acting is fantastic, the narrative is thrilling and keeps you interested in further developments, the movie switches flawlessly between comedy, tension and emotion. It even has a bloody chase scene that is in fact one of the best in my memory. It is a damning critique of cinema as an industry and a love letter to it as an art form. All brought together by Damien Chazelle’s expert direction and Justin Hurwitz’s masterful soundtrack. MASTERPIECE!

indiana_jones	flicks	18sxnhw	1703780253	What are some examples of a movie assuming you would really like/be invested in a specific character but you ended up not liking them at all?	"The most recent example I can think of is Phoebe Waller Bridge's character in Dial of Destiny. Now, I have nothing against her as an actress (it's the only thing I've ever seen her in) and I don't think her performance was bad or anything, but the movie clearly wanted me to really like her character despite making her extremely unsympathetic. One of the first things we saw her do was [spoilers](#s ""leave Indy, a feeble old man who had not wronged her in any way, to die. It was pretty much cold-blooded attempted murder of one of the most beloved characters in history.""). Not only did it not make her sympathetic, it made me think she was a complete sociopath. 

I guess the best comparison I could think of is if Alfred Molina's character in Raiders had survived after betraying Indy and then accompanied him for the rest of the adventure. That would have been really weird, right? Well that's basically what happened in Dial of Destiny lol."	/r/flicks/comments/18sxnhw/what_are_some_examples_of_a_movie_assuming_you/	https://www.reddit.com/r/flicks/comments/18sxnhw/what_are_some_examples_of_a_movie_assuming_you/

"""Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny"" (2023) is a reboot of an adventure film franchise from the '80s. It portrays an aging professor of archaeology as he goes on an adventure.

indiana_jones	flicks	186yyik	1701289101	Anyone seeing The Abyss 4K cut next week in theaters? I didn't realize The Abyss, Leviathan, and Deepstar Six all came out in 1989! (I guess 1989 or ocean / underwater film discussion?)	"(originally posted in horror, but thought it fun and wide ranging enough to bring here)

This is a ""I just finished a big project and I finally have time to ramble to my people"" type of post. Just for fun. Something about the vastness of the Ocean, Thalassophobia and Submechanophobia, etc... I just love these types of films. Next week, I'm on a work trip, and decided to stay overnight one extra night because The Abyss is showing nationally on the 6th at 6p... ONLY. And the physical release isn't til March, even tho streaming isn't til 12th Dec or so.

At 47, I suspect I'm not just ""getting old"" but probably one of the few people that remembers seeing The Abyss in the theater, and I absolutely LOVE this ""lost"" James Cameron film. I know it's sorta horror adjacent, but it is WILD we got Leviathan and Deepstar Six with The Abyss in one single year!   
1989 was a wild film year: Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure, Back to the Future II, Burton, Keaton and Nicholson's Batman, Dead Poet's Society, Major League, Christmas Vacation, Kickboxer. For more horror we got Jason Takes Manhattan, Nightmare on Elm Street with ""Dream Child"", Cyborg, Pet Sematary, The Fly II, Toxic Avenger III, Dead Calm, Shocker.   
I legit want to list every film. What a year!!: https://www.boxofficemojo.com/year/1989/  
As for other ocean and deep sea films... Pacific Rim was slightly deep sea, but other than THE FREAKING BRILLIANT Underwater (seriously, more Stewart in Ellen Ripley like lead roles, please), not a lot of water films as of late?

The Meg was goofy and fine. Deep Blue Sea-like, which was fun. Sphere is also not great but not as bad as reviewed, possibly? I like Virus, and am in the minority. Triangle is an AMAZINGLY well done film (would describe, but spoilers). Also, RIP Treat Williams, but I LOVED Deep Rising, and feel that could have been a franchise. What fun that was. A recent Lovecraftian slow burner called ""Sea Fever"" is worth checking out, for sure.

The Big Blue is an outlier here, but if you love Luc Besson and Jean Reno, and absolutely GORGEOUS films, this would be a ""can't miss"", but it's not horror.

I am fine with the stuff spawned from Open Water, like 47 Meters Down and The Shallows...  
But I'll end my rant with a request: **Any other underwater or on water films to look at? THANKS!**

Lastly:

I was looking up thalassophobia (fear of deep water) and submechanophobia ( irrational fear of submerged man-made objects), and man... humans are a shit show. Here are a few more phobias. LOL

Hydroskourophobia: Fear of deep or dark water.   
Galeophobia or Selachophobia: Fear of sharks.   
Ichthyophobia: Fear of fish.   
Ostraconophobia: Fear of shellfish.   
Kymophobia or Cymophobia: Fear of waves.   
Limnophobia: Fear of lakes.   
Bathophobia: Fear of depths or deep things.   
Megalophobia: Fear of large things."	/r/flicks/comments/186yyik/anyone_seeing_the_abyss_4k_cut_next_week_in/	https://www.reddit.com/r/flicks/comments/186yyik/anyone_seeing_the_abyss_4k_cut_next_week_in/
indiana_jones	flicks	14qskqe	1688508701	"""Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny"" is one final hurrah for old times' sake..."	"The first (and presumably last) non-Steven Spielberg directed “Indiana Jones” movie is not quite the unfocused mess that was “Kingdom of the Crystal Skull,” nor the shockingly-racist horror flick that was “Temple of Doom,” but it’s not among the best of this film series, either. “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny” runs right in the middle of the quality spectrum for this often frustrating series, which hit perfection early on, never to achieve it again.

On the pro-side, the new screenplay is smartly tailored for an older Indiana Jones, and Harrison Ford arguably gives his best performance as the character to date—with all the wisdom and regret one would expect from a man of his considerable (and *unparalleled*) life experiences. For some, this older, regretful Indy might make some yearn for the devil-may-care character we remember from the 1980s, but I really empathized with the emotional journey Ford takes in the film.  I also appreciate the actor’s lack of vanity, as well. With or without the fedora and whip, Ford’s personal well of gravity is the force anchoring this movie—allowing it to work better than it should. 

Editorially, the movie runs about 20 minutes too long, with a sagging midsection and an incongruously hard science-fiction climax (arguably more so than that of “Crystal Skull”). I also wasn’t exactly in love with the desaturated, almost-*smoggy* cinematography of Phedon Papamichael. It only made me miss Douglas Slocombe’s cleaner lines and bolder color pop from the earlier films.

Overall, it’s an appropriately sentimental sendoff for the characters and the franchise. Let’s hope the powers that be at Disney-Lucasfilm finally learn to leave well enough alone this time…

mi7	TrueFilm	1nv83g1	1759325018	One Battle After Another: Paul Thomas Anderson and the Death of Revolutionary Cinema	"Hello again [r/TrueFilm](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/). I watched *One Battle After Another* a few times and posted this review to [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/markcira/film/one-battle-after-another/2/). As someone who loves cars, this is my favourite PTA film by a mile. Below you can read why:

Most directors become disillusioned by politics later in their lives. Especially the Italians. Just take Bertolucci or Pasolini, both committed Marxists and Catholics, who made radical films up until the 1970s. Then they pivoted, became more critical of both the left and the right. For Bertolucci, “he fell out of love with politics.” But for Pasolini, it was more personal, arguing that consumer capitalism destroyed class consciousness. 

Pasolini’s bleakest and most nihilistic political film was also his most infamous: *Salò*. It became well-known for its depravity, moreso than its political critique. And yet, two years before its release, Pasolini admitted in an interview with Le Monde:

&gt;“I can no longer believe in revolution, but I can’t help being on the side of the young people who are fighting for it.”

It’s a line that captures the core contradiction of so many post-revolutionary artists: the loss of belief, but not of allegiance.

Which is what makes Paul Thomas Anderson’s latest *One Battle After Another* both an exception to the rule and a reflection of it. He never made overtly political films like Bertolucci or Pasolini did. Maybe because he belonged to a generation shaped not by the fire of revolution but by the ashes of its failure. By the time Anderson was discovering cinema, the era of militant auteurs had already receded into history.

This generational distance explains, partly, why the Gen-X wave of filmmakers were considerably more skeptical, allergic to dogma. PTA's contemporaries, Tarantino and Nolan, didn't inherit the revolutionary fervor of their European predecessors; they inherited its collapse. It also might explain why both auteurs represent a return to the apolitical craftsmanship of studio-era Hollywood, closer to Howard Hawks or William Wyler than to Godard. Their politics, if present at all, were sublimated into style and genre. The message was no longer the manifesto. It was the medium.

Which makes Anderson's choice for his revolutionaries' name, **the French 75**, so loaded with historical irony. The cocktail appears in Pynchon's *Inherent Vice*, but transforming it into the name of a radical ANTIFA-adjacent group is pure Anderson. The name is perhaps a nod to the French countercultural movements championed by filmmakers like Jean-Luc Godard, who between 1968 and 1972 abandoned commercial filmmaking entirely to produce agitprop with the Dziga Vertov Group—from *La Chinoise* (1967) through *Letter to Jane* (1972). By 1974, the collective had dissolved, and Godard retreated from Maoist militancy into what he would later call his ""wilderness years."" 

In naming American pseudo-revolutionaries after a champagne cocktail with French military origins, Anderson encodes the entire trajectory: revolutionary cinema as imported commodity, radical politics as intoxicant, and the ultimate effervescence of both. The French 75 isn’t exactly resistance. It’s a retreat into aesthetics. Rather, it was what you ordered after the revolution failed. 

And in both this Gen-X reckoning and Tarantino's *Once Upon a Time in Hollywood*, Leonardo DiCaprio becomes the vessel for something darker: someone whose exchanged his dreams with the drink. Where European auteurs once believed cinema could ignite revolution, these films offer a drunken revision for the author’s own reckoning with their complicity in Hollywood's machinery of myth-making, the very apparatus that anesthetized whatever revolutionary impulse the counterculture once possessed.

In Tarantino's revisionism, he takes aim at the bullshit liberalism the hippy counterculture curdled into. Anderson’s target is more formidable: the military industrial complex. It’s a fairer fight, or at least a more honest one. As Hollywood's collaboration with the Pentagon and intelligence agencies deepened throughout the 2000s - [*Zero Dark Thirty*, the Marvel military partnerships, the CIA's script consultations](https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/hollywood-cia-washington-dc-films-fbi-24-intervening-close-relationship-a7918191.html), Gen-X irony started to look less like detachment and more like complicity. The nihilism that seemed like coked-out swagger in the '90s needed some re-evaluation.

Anderson's film, arriving amid this cozy arrangement between entertainment and empire, reads less as political cinema than as confession: here's what we were too stoned, too cynical, or too drunk to fight when it mattered. Bob, then, is a great surrogate for the director. It’s a self-deprecating creation that embodies the kind of apolitical aimlessness of his works pre-*There Will Be Blood*. In both that and *Licorice Pizza*, you saw the politics edging into his canvas. But both also touched upon a different revolution: the industrial revolution and America’s oil empire. *There Will Be Blood* traced how that empire was born in California dirt and blood, while *Licorice Pizza* showed it already fossilized into the 1973 gas crisis, the moment most Americans realized their entire way of life ran on someone else's oil.

Perhaps this is why so much of *One Battle After Another* runs on deliberately similar motifs. Take the first image of the film: Perfidia Beverly Hills (Teyana Taylor) running along the interstate highway in the opposite direction of massive long-haul trucks, a roaring echo of the truck Alana Kane has to reverse down a street in *Licorice Pizza,* as it crawls on empty. *One Battle* closes with Perfidia's daughter Willa climbing into a compact sedan, racing toward a revolution her mother was exiled from. Between these two images - flight and pursuit, mother and daughter, the same California highways - Anderson maps the distance between generations, and the shrinking space left to move.

Or consider that PTA locates his white-knuckle climax set piece as a trilateral car chase set against the [Borrego Springs](https://variety.com/2025/film/features/one-battle-after-another-car-chase-location-breakdown-1236529697/) in California. There is a comedic paradox, undoubtedly known by PTA, about writing a film about a revolution in the car-loving capital of Hollywood. As a car guy (embarrassing I know), that scene homages some of the greatest vehicles ever put to screen:

1. The white Dodge Charger - Introduced in 1966, immortalized two years later when the hitmen in *Bullitt* drove it chasing Steve McQueen through San Francisco. Pure American muscle, the villain's car.
2. The blue Ford Mustang - McQueen's ride in *Bullitt*, the earlier fastback model. American-born and bred, the hero's weapon.
3. The purple Nissan Tsuru - Iconic in Mexico, where it reigned as the most popular car for decades and became the default taxi of Mexico City. A working-class standard, beloved and utilitarian, that barely registered north of the border.

For Anderson to stage this chase with two icons of American cinema mythology - the Charger and Mustang, locked in their eternal *Bullitt* dance - against the Tsuru is to encode the entire geopolitical subtext. The American muscle cars carry Hollywood's fantasy of rebellion: beautiful, loud, built for the chase scene. The Tsuru carries actual revolution: a Mexican guerrilla in a car designed for survival, not spectacle. It's the French 75 paradox in automotive form. American radicalism as performance art versus the real thing crossing the border in a taxi. 

It’s even more exacting in that message when you consider the fate of those American muscle cars. One ends up rear-ended into destruction and the other’s front fender is mutilated. That the only surviving car is the Tsuru is hilarious. The icons of American cinema, the very vehicles that taught us what rebellion looks like on screen, don't make it. They're too heavy, too mythologized, too built for the wrong kind of fight. The Tsuru survives because it was never performing revolution; it was simply doing it. In Anderson's hands, this climax becomes the film's central indictment: how can American political cinema be taken seriously when, for over a century, its grand battles have been little more than sieges for oil?

Furthermore: how can a revolutionary film be produced in the country’s second-largest consumer of oil? A culture so entangled with extraction and consumption cannot help but aestheticize revolt instead of enacting it. Its entire industry packages dissent as genre, as myth, as marketable style, while the very material conditions it critiques are sustained by its own production apparatus. The contradiction is total, and Anderson makes sure we feel the weight of it in that scene. 

It’s so integral to consider just how cars became central symbols of American mythology in this context. From *Bullitt*to *American Graffitti* to the *Fast* franchise today, America's iconography is cemented by its cars and cinema. Coppola understood this when he made *Tucker: The Man and His Dream*, recognizing the automobile industry and cinema as twin mythologies. Both built on innovation, both ultimately strangled by corporate protectionism. On the press tour for *Tetro*, he said:

&gt;”It was about the very thing that we now see so evident in the automobile industry. Sometimes the executives in this industry tend to overly protect the way things are and the way things are done. You see that with film executives. Hollywood is the next Detroit, in my opinion.”

Talk about a prescient fucking quote. But also a diagnostic key for *One Battle After Another*. Every man in Anderson's film reeks of this terminal over-protectiveness. Bob is pathological in his need to shield Willa. Colonel Lockjaw obsessively guards his valor and reputation among his White Supremacist peers. Howard ""Billy Goat"" (Paul Grimstad) - who [bears an uncanny resemblance to a young Coppola](https://d3525k1ryd2155.cloudfront.net/h/918/772/1356772918.0.x.jpg) \- paranoiacally protects the French 75's code words as if they were scripture. When he sits behind his CB Radio, twisting dials, it’s like Coppola and Harry Caul from *The Conversation* collapse into one anxious figure: the artist as surveillance obsessive.

This paternal protectiveness saturates every frame, and Anderson treats it as the film's original sin: not revolution's failure, but the masculine impulse to guard, control, and ultimately suffocate it. Where Detroit's executives protected market share until they had nothing left to protect, these men protect themselves *from* a revolution and *for* a revolution. But to what end? Nostalgia? 

There’s a great image of Bob that feels in conversation with the now-famous meme of Rick Dalton in *Once Upon a Time in Hollywood* [pointing at his TV set](https://uploads.dailydot.com/2020/04/leo-pointing.jpg?auto=compress&amp;fm=pjpg&amp;w=2000&amp;h=1000) in recognition of himself. It’s Bob trying desperately to keep his roach cherry lit while watching *Battle of Algiers*. Both are a man glimpsing into the past for self-identification. Both men (and directors) are defined by their relationship to screens, and both can mistake consumption for participation. 

While Rick's delusion is almost innocent: he really was on that TV show, he really did throw those punches (however choreographed). Bob's delusion is sadder, a longing for a fight he once fought alongside his love. While Rick pointing says ""that's me""; Bob lighting up says ""that could be me."" A nostalgia for a revolution that never did. Tarantino's joke is about Hollywood eating itself through the television but Anderson's is darker. It's about American Hollywood radicalism as pure affect, revolutionary identity built entirely from myth. The roach goes out. The film keeps playing. 

Another revealing paradox that both Pynchon and Anderson recognized was America's most radical revolutionary movements and the societies that tried to thwart them, incubated in California, the very state built on oil. The Black Panthers, founded in Oakland in 1966 and serving as the clear template for Anderson's French 75, arose in the East Bay. The Bohemian Grove (one of several models for the film's Christmas Adventurers), a secret society of presidents, oil executives, and defense contractors was created in Sonoma County. California's geography literalizes the contradiction: revolutionary Oakland and establishment Bohemian Grove separated by a few hours' drive along highways built by Standard Oil money.

This isn't coincidence, but causality. Oil, like movies, made California what it is: the freeways that enabled white flight and suburban sprawl, the petrochemical plants that poisoned poor neighborhoods, the economic boom that created both massive wealth and the underclass that would revolt against it. The Panthers emerged in Oakland not despite the oil infrastructure but because of it, organizing in the shadow of Richmond's refineries, recruiting from communities devastated by the very industry that powered California's myth of endless expansion. And the Grove? It's where the architects of that oil empire retreated to congratulate themselves, to perform their mock-pagan rituals, while planning the policies that would crush the movements gestating an hour away. 

It feels deliberate that the film is bookended by car chases. First, through the busy streets of an unnamed California city. This sequence feels in direct homage to New York’s *The French Connection* and *Night of the Juggler*. While the final one, through the long stretches of the hilly desert landscape, are right out of Spielberg’s West-Coast debut *Duel* or James Cameron’s West-coast chase in *Terminator 2*. Wedged in the middle of the film is a rooftop chase on foot between the police and Bob. 

That particular chase, for me, punctuates Bob as surrogate for PTA. Here is an older guy trying to keep up with the youth who now run on foot and skateboards. It is the arthouse equivalent of [How Do You Do, Fellow Kids?](https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/018/666/How_Do_You_Do_Fellow_Kids_meme_banner_image.jpg). Here is Anderson humbly establishing his place in the New World. That he should end that sequence homaging the great rooftop falls of, say, Buster Keaton in [Three Ages](https://www.reddit.com/r/silentmoviegifs/comments/d08tbp/buster_keaton_had_planned_to_make_this_jump_in/) (1923) is really exposing the master's age. But also the timelessness of cinema's oldest gags. That, yes, there is something kinda cringe about an older director trying to hold onto the ledge of his past triumphs in contemporary culture, but that revolutions, like that rooftop fall, are cyclical. The old gag resurfaces in new contexts, the artist lands hard but gets back up, and the chase continues.

Since its release, critics have been chasing PTA down about his cultural clout in surfacing such politically heated subjects. And fair enough. You can't help but feel Anderson get defensive when Bob gets in an argument with Comrade Josh about being ""nitpick-y” about the answer to his passcode. It's the director forecasting the reviews critical of his political maneuvering, but also perhaps the auteur poking fun at his own reputation as a meticulous formalist: the filmmaker accused of caring more about tracking shots than social justice, more about period detail than present urgency. To have portrayed revolutionaries in the most accurate light would actually sap the paranoid comedy of its juice. 

Bob's exasperation with Josh mirrors the criticism lobbed at Anderson himself: that his films are beautiful but “he ain’t that guy.” But the self-awareness becomes the argument. By letting Bob fumble through these confrontations, by making him the butt of the joke rather than its teller, Anderson admits what his critics have always suspected: that he might not have all the answers, that he “doesn’t know what time it is.” It’s at this moment when Bob has to go above ranks to get some recognition. 

Here, like other moments, you see Anderson create these disturbing mirrors between the military rank and file and the revolutionary rank and file. When Bob calls for his “superior,” it’s ultimately the joke at the expense of Bob, but also at the expense of the Leftist navel-gazing revolutionaries. These kids who scorn authority structures have simply rebuilt them with different titles. It's Anderson's sharpest observation: that every movement, no matter how radical its rhetoric, eventually reproduces the systems it claims to oppose. The irony isn't lost on Bob, or on Anderson. Both are asking permission from people who theoretically don't believe in permission. Both are navigating bureaucracies that insist they aren't bureaucracies. And both are discovering that the New World looks suspiciously like the old one.

This is, perhaps, also Anderson reckoning with his own fate, of becoming the establishment that the new generation of filmmakers seek to destroy. It feels like a film centred around a child being stuck in between the military industrial complex and the burnout pseudo-revolutionary is about the tug of war between tradition and revolution, between the old guard and the insurgents, between the canon and its would-be destroyers. If you were to take account of every film made with revolutionary ideas versus films that galvanized and glamourized the military, the latter would win by a landslide. 

Cinema has always been more comfortable with the aesthetics of power, rather than with the messy work of dismantling it. It's probably why Bertolucci exchanged the radical fervour of *Before the Revolution* for the sumptuous majesty of *The Last Emperor*. Anderson knows this. Even his own filmography leans toward the powerful: oil barons carving up California in *There Will Be Blood*, fashion obsessed Woodcock in *Phantom Thread,* cult leader Dodd in \*The Master.\*He's made a career out of rendering American ambition. What interests me about *One Battle* and, to some extent, *Licorice* is that here is a director trying to traverse directory into a weirder route, an action comedy as directed by Robert Downey Sr. 

We also bear witness to Anderson tackling action terrifically. Say what you will about the politics, you really can’t argue with the technical prowess of the chase sequences. Anderson takes the formal chops from those Pentagon-vetted (CIA-funded) *Mission Impossible* films and supplants them into the counter-operative. But then he has enough self-awareness to know he can’t pull that shit off when Sergio calls him Tom Cruise, shortly before Bob just hits the road with a pathetic tuck and roll. Folks might argue Anderson satirizes the revolutionaries unfairly. But, I mean, the villains are literally called the Christmas Adventurers. This is like something out of William Klein’s *Mr. Freedom*.

And again, with that Christmas Adventurers club, we find the lower ranked member played by the heir to Hollywood royalty, Tony Goldwyn, grandson to the legendary film producer Samuel Goldwyn. I don't think PTA is casting the guy who literally tries to chase Willa down and blow her head off with a shotgun by accident. Willa, like the film itself, becomes the target that old Hollywood, as embodied by Goldwyn's lineage, wants to destroy. 

Legacy cinema, is always threatened by something scrappier and less polished (see: 1970s New Hollywood), and takes aim. Willa isn’t just taking control of the Dodge Charger (the past), she’s destroying it in bloody spectacle. Anderson casts Hollywood royalty as the executioner chasing down his own messy, unruly creation.

The fact that Virgil (Goldwyn) drives a Blue Mustang GT, the modern equivalent of Steve McQueen's chariot in Bullitt, and nearly kills himself at top speed of that chase is brilliant. The establishment appropriating the iconography of rebellion, turning countercultural cool into a weapon against the actual counterculture. This is fascinating filmmaking disguised as a stoner comedy.

Undergirding all of the comedic spectacle, there is tragedy within *One Battle*. I think it's unfair to say that political movements don't, by necessity, mirror the institutions they oppose. In various accounts within the Black Panther Party - which was 2/3rds women, by the way - you had Elaine Brown who wrote in her autobiography, *A Taste of Power*:

&gt;Ericka, my daughter, who, at seven years old, had never lived with her mother. There was a disturbing unfamiliarity in having her close. I had been a Black Panther all the years of her life-not her mother, in any meaningful way. Perhaps it was that in the apartment there was space to finally look at myself after thirty-four years of living with others. All of it seemed strange and uncomfortable.

Revolutions kinda demands the same sacrifice as the empire: the erasure of the personal, the subordination of family to a cause, the sublimation to the collective. Then sometimes that collective betrays your sacrifice. Lockjaw sacrifices his life and gets brutally betrayed by his Christmas club. His final cremation echoing the infamous [“Cremation of Care” ritual at Bohemian Grove](https://whorulesamerica.ucsc.edu/power/bg_photos/024.jpg)

. Perfidia sacrifices her comrades and, ultimately, her daughter. In her wake, Bob lives in lingering grief, but Willa is a constant reminder of Perfidia’s sacrifice. No wonder he doesn’t want to lose her..Thus, another paradox emerges in the story. Sometimes we get overly protective of the people (and things) we love because we *know* what was sacrificed in order to keep them alive. 

It’s why that dad rock needle drop of Steely Dan’s *Dirty Work*to Willa practicing Karate brought me to tears upon 2nd viewing. It is Anderson as his most personal as a father, and as his most crucially sensitive as a Cancerian filmmaker. When Bob is at a teacher-parent interview, he tries to hold back his tears of pride by politicizing the classroom. Pointing out the flaws of American History academia. Politics are the personal, sure. But the scene begs a better question: how do we use politics as something to guard against our emotions? How do politics  sublimate the personal? We laugh at Bob, but we also kinda want to cry. 

This is the formal chops of a master and ultimately why I think this is one of those “once in a generation” films. I don’t say that lightly. The great European political filmmakers of the 60s and 70s didn’t so much abandon politics as they did understand their limits. Their filmmaking bent toward the private and the interior. Bertolucci gave us *The Dreamers,* where the revolution of 68 are already remembered through an intimate bedroom. Godard retreated into personal video essays about memory. In other words, they moved from the political to the personal.

What Anderson does here isn't retreat from the political or the personal but a head-on collision of both, with a twist of that good ol’ American spectacle. The spectacle doesn't negate the politics. It's the only language Anderson has left. As an American, as a Hollywood director, he can’t escape the fact that his politics arrive packaged in car chases and needle drops, in the aesthetic fetish of VistaVision. This is what makes it generational. Not because it solves anything or “gets it right” but because it's the first American film in decades willing to show the seams, to let the contradictions breathe, to admit that he’s kinda caught in the vines of a revolution that’s he both started and is too late for, yet still somehow trying. Like traversing those hilly canyons, not knowing what's ahead but catching glimpses of what's worth chasing, even if - like drunken Bob in a Tsuru - you never quite catch up."	/r/TrueFilm/comments/1nv83g1/one_battle_after_another_paul_thomas_anderson_and/	https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/1nv83g1/one_battle_after_another_paul_thomas_anderson_and/
mi7	movies	1nsye8g	1759090462	Why did the Fast and the Furious franchise turn into Mission Impossible movies?	It’s honestly puzzling how the Fast and the Furious franchise shifted so drastically in tone after the third film. The early movies were grounded in underground car culture, street racing, and gritty character rivalries. But by the time the fourth and fifth entries rolled around, it had practically transformed into Mission Impossible with muscle cars, complete with globe trotting espionage, elaborate heists, and superhuman stunts that defy physics. Why did a series that started with boosting DVD players suddenly involve stopping nuclear submarines and international terrorist plots? Was this a natural evolution to keep audiences entertained, or a complete abandonment of its roots to chase blockbuster trends? It raises the question of whether the franchise lost its original identity in the process. Thoughts?	/r/movies/comments/1nsye8g/why_did_the_fast_and_the_furious_franchise_turn/	https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1nsye8g/why_did_the_fast_and_the_furious_franchise_turn/
mi7	TrueFilm	1npac07	1758715582	What decisions led to the first hour of Mission Impossible: The Final Reckoning being so dull?	"The first hour of Mission Impossible: The Final Reckoning is terrible. But the rest of the film is pretty great, with two absolutely stunning action sequences. What do you think is behind the directorial choices that led to that pointlessly flabby first hour?

 Here’s what that hour contains:

* One or two short, fairly un-amazing action scenes, and this film’s only use of rubber masks.
* Exposition concerning the Entity taking over the world. Nothing wrong with establishing some real stakes, but there’s far too much of it.
* Shoehorning of previous films into this film’s continuity. We all know they were written as stand-alone films with no over-arching story, so why insult everyone’s intelligence by expecting us to pretend otherwise?
* Praising Ethan Hunt as basically the saviour of the world. I guess this is OK because he kind of is, but they’re over-doing it.
* “Flash-forwards” to Luther in hospital. They’re not actually flash-forwards, and they don’t contribute anything to the plot, the world-building or anything else. Why were these scenes even left in?
* Talk about the perils of decompression, two different decompression chambers, and what gas he’ll be breathing. Turns out to be of only minor importance to the story, so no idea why they spent so much time setting it up.
* “You have to take the key to the sub, get the device and plug it into the other device that the baddie’s got”. This is really all the set-up the film needs, and could have been done extremely quickly. Or just start in media res, and catch us up on the fly.

Long movies used to be seen as problematic because the longer the film, the fewer showings you can have per day, and the less money you’ll make. So why didn’t this apply here? With the film being so expensive, you think they’d want to get as many bums on seats as possible.

Judging from instalments 5-6 (possibly 7), McQuarrie clearly knows what makes these films work, and what audiences want. So why does he drop the ball so badly with a full hour of wheel spinning? Why not get straight to the good stuff with the submarine sequence, and have an incredible 2 hour movie?

Movies don’t reach their finished form by accident, so these failings are all the result of directorial decisions. But does anyone have any theories or information as to what lay behind those decisions?"	/r/TrueFilm/comments/1npac07/what_decisions_led_to_the_first_hour_of_mission/	https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/1npac07/what_decisions_led_to_the_first_hour_of_mission/

mi7	movies	1ng6k0k	1757791936	I came to appreciate Mission Impossible 8: I realized its a power fantasy for retirement age men facing cognitive decline	"Needless to say all of these films have been been male power fantasies. But I feel this one narrows it down to one age group.

Tom Cruise, Chris McQuarrie and their whole team have proven themselves to be competent film makers time and time again, so the only way I can rationalize the baffling choices in the story structure and plot as genius is if they had the very specific target audience of retirement age men facing congnitive decline.

Tom Cruise's Ethan Hunt is a character that has saved the world again and again. Everyone praises him as the only guy that has never let them down and they completely trust as the only person capable of saving them.

He is essentially a larger than life family working man now at the end of his career, the whole world is his family. Men at this age have a lot of self doubt of their ability as providers for their family, to me the constant praise got ridiculous but for them it must have felt reassuring.


Next, while watching I found the editing to be atrocious. The movie kept constantly showing flashbacks to previous scenes from previous movies and sometimes even the scenes that take place in the same movie. However if I think about it in the context that its for old people that might have trouble remembering stuff the editing is an inspired choice.


The main antagonist of the film is ""The Entity"", an AI which is just a concept, kind of a cosmic gumbo. It represents a fear of the unknown and of the future, some old people have a hard time embracing change and learning new things, but they feel the world is changing by these new development and feel like outsiders. I think ""The Entity"" is that feeling. Some even view the new thing as wrong and feel self righteous in their old ideas. Ethan Hunt beating up a guy and yelling ""Stop spending so much time on the internet!"" corroborates this.


Overall while watching it I thought as expected the set pieces and stunts were amazing but I was disliking it because of the editing and story choices.
My initial reaction was that it is a loony tunes cartoon with a messiah complex. However when I had this realization I came to appreciate it more.


Every one should have art that speaks to them, even grumpy old men. which is why I'm giving this movie 10/10."	/r/movies/comments/1ng6k0k/i_came_to_appreciate_mission_impossible_8_i/	https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1ng6k0k/i_came_to_appreciate_mission_impossible_8_i/

mi7	movies	1n1idav	1756304433	Anyone else feel a little underwhelmed with Mission Impossible: The Final Reckoning?	"Mission Impossible has long been one of the best, most consistent series of Hollywood blockbusters. The first ""trilogy"" was pretty solid, and the 2nd run of Ghost Protocol/Rogue Nation/Fallout is legitimately some of the greatest action movie filmmaking ever. Dead Reckoning was good enough but didn't really hit the same highs - although maybe COVID is to blame for that.

I was pretty excited for Final Reckoning given that it's the closing chapter of this generally awesome series, and it's almost 3 hours long - couldn't wait to see all the amazing stunts and set pieces we'd be getting, considering this is the end and the amount of time Christopher Macquarrie has to play with.

In reality though, I was pretty underwhelmed with what the movie delivered. The pacing is seriously wonky - it starts off very slowly and the first 40-45 minutes is all exposition and flashbacks...but it also feels like it resolves way too quickly at the end. The editing seemed a little off too, with scenes jumping from one another with some rather choppy transitions.

I'm somewhat mixed on the action set pieces we got. The 2 big ones - Ethan's exploration of the downed submarine and the aerial chase at the end - are both really good in a vacuum. The sub escape goes beyond even the level of disbelief you need for these movies though, especially near the end with Ethan swimming like 300m through freezing cold water without a gas mask. And the plane chase felt too reminiscent of the climax in Fallout although admittedly it was way more intense and edge of your seat with Tom Cruise hanging off the planes themselves. 

Outside of these 2 though, the movie felt oddly free of the excitement and intensity the MI series typically has. It's weird but it felt almost kind of small considering the stakes were end-of-the-world? Like it didn't really give off ""closing chapter"" vibes to me. And I actually think we could've done with one or two more big set pieces. They kinda did Gabriel dirty as the final big bad too. He was menacing and sinister in Dead Reckoning but he came off as a Looney Tunes cartoon villain here and &gt;!his death scene was ridiculous.!&lt;

It was still fairly enjoyable but maybe I just expected more considering the high bar movies 4-6 set, as well as this being the final chapter of the series."	/r/movies/comments/1n1idav/anyone_else_feel_a_little_underwhelmed_with/	https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1n1idav/anyone_else_feel_a_little_underwhelmed_with/

They included smaller pieces from movies like Dial of Destiny which whatever you think of the movie this piece was incredible with a single violinist as the focus. And the Jaws score for when they all go out on the boat.

When the Star Wars segment begins a ton of lightsabers light up in the crowd... the whole place is lit up... it's pretty gorgeous.

The film is instantly less charming than its predecessor, and it’s full of gunplay in the first 45 minutes. The characters feel much less accessible, there’s a kid for some reason, and the plot is pretty contrived. 


Some of my questions:
- how quickly was this greenlit after the success of the first Mummy?
- did this script go through a bunch of rewrites?
- was there explicit influence by other contemporary films (my main thought is Mission Impossible) that led to specific plotting decisions?
- how quick was this shoot? Did they make compromises on budget? It looks way worse than the first film.

I went to see the last Mission Impossible movie with my father last sunday, in a theater in France. In this movie, countries with nuclear weapons are mentionned often, and there are maybe three or four moments when we see a serie of flags being shown quickly (if you saw the movie, you know what I'm referring to).

Now, the first time this happened in the movie, I thought I missed the French flag. Maybe I blinked at the wrong moment. Then it happens a second time and there, I pay attention : no French flag!

Wait, it's weird, why would they show the 6 or 7 other flags but not the French one? 

Then all the other moments when this shot is shown in the movie, I really pay close attentin : no French flag. I am sure of it.

So now I'm wondering : did they forget about it? I don't think so. Is it considered wrong to show the flag of the country where the film is being shown on a &gt;!nuclear missile!&lt;? 

It made me wonder if in other countries, the same thing happened with the local flag. So if you're living in the US, UK, Israel, Pakistan, India, China, Russia... or North Korea but I'm not confident on getting answers from there... Did you notice something off with the flags? Or was the French flag missing in your movies too?

The Top 10 earned a combined $152 million this weekend. That's 0.2% up from last year, when ***Despicable Me 4*** debuted atop.

Debuting at #1, ***Jurassic World Rebirth*** debuted with $92 million in 4,308 theaters. Adding in its numbers from Wednesday and Thurday, the film earned an incredible $147.8 million. This is hard to compare with the previous ***Jurassic World*** films, as all films opened on Friday. So just for reference; ***Fallen Kingdom*** earned $148 million on its first 3 days, and ***Dominion*** made $145 million.

What does this debut suggest? What everyone always knew: people love dinosaurs. And that has always been the franchise's biggest advantage. There are no other dino franchises currently, which has allowed Universal to cater to an audience that wants to see these monsters in the big screen. There's a lot of franchises that have experienced fatigue, but the ***Jurassic*** clearly is still beloved 32 years later after its debut in theaters.

The film had a very rushed production; it was officially announced in January 2024, although a script was written for quite some time. Gareth Edwards was hired one month later, when the current release date was already set. So basically the film was reported, filmed and released in the span of just 18 months. That's very short for a blockbuster. But then again, audiences don't pay much attention to productions. What they care for is if the film looks interesting or catches their interest, and Universal achieved it. They sold it as a ""back to basics"" film, choosing to just abandon all characters from the prior films and focus on new characters, played by Scarlett Johansson, Mahershala Ali, Jonathan Bailey. Turns it out all worked out.

According to Universal, 61% of the audience was male. The films are popular with families, although ***Rebirth*** starts to point that it's losing some young audience members. Only 36% of the audience was 25 and under, which is below ***Fallen Kingdom*** (56%) and ***Dominion*** (41%). At the end of the day, that's pretty much imminent when your franchise is 30 years old.

So yes, everything worked out in the end. Well, almost everything. What did ***Rebirth*** fail at? Reception. Critics were unimpressed with the film, giving it a mediocre 52% on RT. Somehow, that was an improvement over the past two films, but that's still not a good score. Regardless, the debut suggests the audience was still excited to watch the film. But the film's word of mouth indicates that this will play very, very differently, and that's another thing were ***Rebirth*** failed.

Audiences gave ***Jurassic World Rebirth*** a very weak ""B"" on CinemaScore, which is very poor for a blockbuster. That's worse than any of the ***Jurassic World*** films, and it's the second lowest in the franchise, just above ***Jurassic Park III*** (""B–""). This is an indication that audiences are not content with the film. It's hard to point to a domestic total prediction given that this is a 5-day debut, but with high competition like ***Superman*** and ***The Fantastic Four: First Steps*** arriving, it's very likely the film will continue the franchise's decline at the box office. Definitely a success, but it's gonna put a lot of pressure on the next film.

Last week's champ ***F1*** added $25.7 million this weekend. That's a rough 55% drop from last week, but when you have a juggernaut like ***Jurassic World***, a drop like that is pretty much imminent. Through 10 days, the film has amassed $109.2 million domestically, the first Apple title to hit that milestone. There's still heavy competition on its way, but ***F1*** should still have enough gas left to hit $160 million domestically.

In third place, ***How to Train Your Dragon*** dipped 43%, adding $11.2 million this weekend. That took its domestic total to $224.2 million, finally becoming the franchise's biggest film in the domestic market.

There doesn't appear to be any signs of life in Disney/Pixar's ***Elio***. It dropped 45% and made just $5.7 million. That drop is barely better than last week, indicating word of mouth isn't really doing anything to save the film. The film has made an abysmal $55 million so far, and it's going to struggle to hit $65 million at this rate.

***28 Years Later*** remained at #5, although it still dropped 53% and added $4.5 million this weekend. At least that's better than last week's steep 67% drop, but it's still rough. The film has already earned $60.2 million, and it should finish with around $67 million domestically.

***M3GAN 2.0*** continued disappointing on its second weekend. The film collapsed a poor 61%, earning just $3.9 million this weekend. That's far worse than the original's second weekend drop (a very light 39.8%). The sequel has earned a very poor $18.7 million, which is a colossal 68% behind the original through the same point. With more competition on its way, it's highly likely the film will finish with less than $25 million domestically.

***Lilo &amp; Stitch*** dropped 45% and earned $3.8 million. The film has amassed $408.5 million so far.

In eighth place, ***Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning*** eased just 34% and added $2.7 million this weekend. The film's domestic total stands at $191.1 million, and it will soon pass ***Rogue Nation*** ($195 million) to become the fourth biggest film in the franchise.

***Materialists*** had another rough drop this weekend. This time, it dropped 55% and added $1.3 million. That took its total to $33.5 million.

Rounding out the Top 10 was the 41st anniversary re-release of ***This Is Spinal Tap***. It earned $1 million from 1,015 theaters, taking its lifetime gross to $5.7 million. Man, it should've made $1.1 million, come on.

#**OVERSEAS**

***Jurassic World Rebirth*** debuted with $174 million overseas, for a monster $322.6 million worldwide debut. China was its biggest debut with $41.5 million, which is the biggest for a Hollywood title this year. However, it should be noted that the film was quite front-loaded in the market amidst poor word of mouth. Other strong debuts were seen in the UK ($16.6M), Mexico ($13.9M), Germany ($7.6M), South Korea ($7.4M), Spain ($6.5M), Australia ($5.9M), India ($5.5M/best of franchise), France ($5.3M) and Italy ($4.7M).

All the ***Jurassic World*** films have cracked $1 billion, but don't expect the same to happen to ***Rebirth***. Not only was it lower than ***Dominion*** $392 million worldwide debut, but most of these debuts were all from 5-day debuts, which is boosting its numbers. For now, a $800 million worldwide total is likely. Another success in the franchise, but it will continue marking another decline.

***F1*** was impacted domestically, but it continues killing it overseas. Despite the arrival of ***Rebirth***, the film dipped just 38% and added $56.3 million overseas, taking its worldwide total to $293 million. It's already Apple's biggest film worldwide. In China, the film had an insane 2% second weekend drop, which is the best for a Hollywood title this year, and now the film is set to massively over-perform in the market. The best markets are China ($22M), the UK ($17.3M), Mexico ($12.3M), France ($11.5M) and Australia ($9.8M). Assuming it keeps holding very well, the film should definitely pass $450 million worldwide.

***How to Train Your Dragon*** added $21 million overseas, taking its worldwide total to $519 million. The best markets are China ($35.5M), Mexico ($33.4M), the UK ($24.6M), Brazil ($17.2M) and France ($14.2M). It has already passed the original film's worldwide gross, and by tomorrow it will pass ***The Hidden World*** ($520 million).

***28 Years Later*** added $7 million overseas, allowing it to cross $125 million worldwide. The UK has been its biggest market, unsurprisingly, earning $17 million so far. The film should finish with around $140 million worldwide.

Continuing its absolutely pathetic run in pretty much every territory, Disney/Pixar's ***Elio*** made $6.7 overseas, taking its worldwide total to just $97.7 million worldwide. The best markets are France ($4.7M), the UK ($4.1M), South Korea ($3.6M), China ($3.5M) and Mexico ($2.8M). 3 weeks in and a Pixar title still hasn't cracked $100 million worldwide. What a time to be alive.

***Lilo &amp; Stitch*** added $6.1 overseas, taking its worldwide total to $972 million. That allowed it to finally pass ***A Minecraft Movie*** as the year's second highest grossing film, just behind ***Ne Zha 2***. The best markets are Mexico ($66.5M), the UK ($48.3M), France ($40.5M), Brazil ($36.5M) and Germany ($30.8M).

With $3.9 million overseas, ***Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning*** has officially passed ***Dead Reckoning*** worldwide with a $576.1 million total, becoming the fourth biggest film in the franchise.

#**FILMS THAT ENDED THEIR RUN THIS WEEK**

Movie | Release Date | Studio | Domestic Opening | Domestic Total | Worldwide Total | Budget |
----------|----------|----------|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:
*A Minecraft Movie* | Apr/4 | Warner Bros. | $162,753,003 | $423,949,195 | $954,928,702 | $150M

- *A Minecraft Movie* has closed its run with a fantastic $954 million worldwide. Considering the insanely negative response to its first teaser, it's still a sign of the brand's strength that it could make almost $1 billion. Of course, the film's legs were very mediocre (2.60x is not great at all for family films, given those easily pass 3x), which is a sign that they weren't fully satisfied by the film itself. Whenever the sequel comes up, they must deliver something better than this, quality-wise.

#**THIS WEEKEND**

A new era of DC begins this weekend.

That's because it's the arrival of DC's ***Superman***, the first film in the new DC Universe (DCU). Written and directed by James Gunn, it stars David Corensweet as the Man of Steel, and it follows Superman's journey to reconcile his alien heritage with his adoptive human family. To say that expectations are high for this film is selling it short. As previously mentioned, this is gonna kick off a new DC Universe, after the DCEU had the insane distinction of having 8 box office flops in a row. And that's not even including the absolute misfire of ***Joker: Folie à Deux***. Needless to say, the brand is at an all-time low and ***Superman*** will need to win over people. With a high $225 million budget and an extensive marketing campaign, this film really needs to be a home run for the sake of DC.

mi7	movies	1ltgkw2	1751848326	With all the superhero &amp; tentpoles films regularly costing $200+ million, we should be in a new golden age of action cinema. Yet it feels like the opposite is true. Since Mad Max Fury Road, Big budget filmmaking seems to have hit an action plateau.	"Look at the Mission Impossible franchise. 400 million for the lastest film yet not a single sequence comes close to matching the franchises action apex. The first films train Chunnel sequence or the Burj Khalifa climb in MI4. 


I hate to turn this into a “back in the day” thing but when cgi was advancing year after year in the early 90s-2010s it really felt like action cinema has being topped every couple years along with it. Studios would pour millions into R&amp;D to create a sequence or sequences such as Spiderman fighting Doc Ock or Neo fighting dozens of Agent Smiths or Anakin Skywalker Podracing, twisters demolishing a town or LOTR with Aargorn defending helms deep, the Rohirrim charge &amp; Mines of Moria. These sequences would be planned and detailed so that visual effects companies knew what could or couldn’t be done with the tech available.

It was as if break thrus were created just to have these sorts of sequences. And I’m not saying action sucks today’s or it’s bad. No. It just seems like there isn’t that focused “set piece” style of filmmaking. Like the car chase in Matrix Reloaded. Or Davey Jones sending the Kraken after Jack Sparrow. Or T-Rex terrorizing a couple kids and eating a lawyer.

Audiences were seeing things we had never seen before. Transformers fighting in a city? Awesome. But over time? Superhero’s battling gets stale. Thousands of computer generated armies clashing gets stale. 

What are some iconic action beats made within the last 5-6 years? What, if anything do you feel is holding films from making more iconic action? Personally, while I’ve seen some quality action films like John Wick, I haven’t seen anything top Fury Road."	/r/movies/comments/1ltgkw2/with_all_the_superhero_tentpoles_films_regularly/	https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1ltgkw2/with_all_the_superhero_tentpoles_films_regularly/

For me ""The Green Knight"" had a great trailer full of compelling visuals and I was excited to see Gawain get the big screen A24 treatment, but found the film to be a letdown. It's not that it's a bad film, it just was not what I expected. 

Sequels:

Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part 1 was such a bummer after a franchise high with Fallout.

The Accountant 2 - buddy film molded into the world of ""The Accountant"". It didn't embrace what made the first one a sleeper hit.

mi7	TrueFilm	1leeu0a	1750246663	Examples of good and bad film editing	"I watched Mission Impossible 2 at the weekend, and it occurred to me that the biggest problem with the film is its editing. The dialogue scenes do their job plot-wise, but they drag. Scenes go on for far too long, and at times even non-action scenes are in slow motion, presumably in an attempt to give them an emotional impact they totally don’t deserve. With only a re-edit this film would still not be a classic, but it would be much better.

Peter Jackson’s King Kong is another one that’s flaccid at times when it should be romping along. In the book Anything You Can Imagine, Jackson even said that if the studio wanted to do a 20th anniversary edition, he’d be happy to edit 20 minutes off it.

On the positive side, my all time best example of good editing would have to be Return of the King. The way it seamlessly cuts between characters and locations, really makes it feel like the characters are all part of the same story, even when their individual storylines are quite different.

So what are your examples of good and bad editing, as well as your thoughts on editing in general? I don’t know much about it to be honest, so it would be great to learn more."	/r/TrueFilm/comments/1leeu0a/examples_of_good_and_bad_film_editing/	https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/1leeu0a/examples_of_good_and_bad_film_editing/

I’ve never watched the mission impossible films so thought I might do those. Watched the first Matrix film for the first time the other day so maybe I’ll watch the others.

mi7	movies	1l9u6zg	1749753424	Mission Impossible 3 - the one that saved the franchise?	"This movie probably saved the franchise after the failure that was part 2. Part 3 is not even a return to formula, since the original from 1996 is much slower paced and flat compared to this installment. It is much better.

One of the key things this movie does is that it assumes the audience is capable of inferring information from context instead of going for exposition dumps. There is this nifty scene at the beginning where Ethan Hunt can apparently follow a conversation from across the room, outside of normal hearing range. At least, that is what the group assumed. We, the audience, can immediately infer that Ethan can read lips based on this small interaction.

You get introduced to the bad guy and his cruelty within the first 10 minutes. From there it is a non stop snowball from bad to worse, each following scene more tense than the next. The Shanghai rabbits foot raid was well executed. The movie opted to not show the heist - just the blueprint and the subsequent outcome. Ethan comes crashing out of the windows, yelling that he was not able to make it to the roof. Your mind fills in the blank. The firefight you never see, the attempts to flee to the roof, and what must have caused Ethan to agree to the higher risk of jumping out from a lower altitude.

The movie also features a ""double-double cross"" that I genuinely did not see coming. The other scenes, such as the faceswap at the vatican or the bridge ambush are exceptionally thrilling. The Shanghai rabbits foot chase, where Ethan finds ingenious but also realistic ways of finding his team an escape (leaning out 10 inches above the road from a speeding vehicle). The ending tops it, where the Ethan goes full iconic Tom Cruise sprint to save his wife at the very last second. Ethan at times seems vulnerable, and in this scene especially so. He has to rely on his wife, who is untrained, to save both him and the world from disaster. 

It all comes together to create one of the best action movies of the 2000's. It's almost perfect - I only found the soundtrack to be very distracting at times. Besides that one nitpick, it is close to a masterpiece in thrilling storytelling, action and character development."	/r/movies/comments/1l9u6zg/mission_impossible_3_the_one_that_saved_the/	https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1l9u6zg/mission_impossible_3_the_one_that_saved_the/

It reminds me of all the bad movies that came out in the 2000s. It was like they had just discovered slow motion, electric guitar and rapid zoom. The movie already outstays its welcome but having to watch Tom Cruise do a backflip in slow motion for the nthteenth time makes it so much worse.

This movie is like one of those obnoxious Abercrombie shopping bags from back in the day, where you had this fit and polished shirtless man staring at you all day after you spent 200 dollars too much on printed t-shirts and vests. Including the headache from the perfume wafting from the air vents.

mi7	movies	1l4pwcr	1749208816	What is the Greatest Action Film Franchise?	"With Mission Impossible seemingly over for now, a lot of iconic action film franchises have seemingly had their last chapters for the past few years. A few of the film series that could be considered among the greatest Action franchises are:

* James Bond: Has had so many eras and while they've rarely revolutionized the genre after the 60s, 007 has pretty much become and institution for classic adventure and action cinema.
* Indiana Jones: Raiders is considered one of the most important in the genre. The trilogy is generaly considered well regarded, while the 4th and 5th instalments were more divisive.
* Mad Max: 2 and Fury Road have both been named the greeatest films in the genre at different points. While Furiosa floped, the film was still very well received.
* Die Hard: Similar case to Indiana Jones but the case of diminishing returns in the sequels is arguably worse.
* Matrix: First one is an all-time classic in the genre. The following 3 are very divisive.
* Mission Impossible: Fallout was hailed as ""the greatest action film since Fury Road"" and on the whole, this film series has been very consistent and well liked.
* Bourne: Trilogy is highly regarded but it seems like the franchise has lost momentum.
* The Raid Duology: Made outside of hollywood and both films had such wild stunts... soon after, Hollywood started adapting.
* John Wick: As far as I know, no single film in the John Wick has had the impact and reception of Raiders of the Lost Ark or Fury Road, but they've consistently had some of the greatest stunts in a film series. Might even be the most consistent film series in this list.

Then there are some other 80s-2000s films that are iconinc but also had varying receptions, like Rambo, Lethal Weapon and Taken.

While Mission Impossible and John Wick have often been the most referenced franchises in the genre recently, I personaly would rank Mad Max as the king of the genre. Those films have been very auteristic, have evolved A LOT and it also feels like they have been trying to be more challenging when it comes to themes and storytelling.

While most of these franchises will continue in some way, all of them have had some sort of ""Final Chapter"" recently. So i'm curious to see how others would rank them."	/r/movies/comments/1l4pwcr/what_is_the_greatest_action_film_franchise/	https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1l4pwcr/what_is_the_greatest_action_film_franchise/

"If you guys have ever watched an Indian movies specifically Bollywood you will notice something interesting around the middle which is an interval or intermission. There is like a 10-15 min break in the screening and allows people to get some snack &amp; get a stretch or use the washroom without missing anything in the movie. The intermission comes at an interesting time in the plot but before the next act begins.

I know this really isn't the culture in Hollywood or most international cinema but I think it could be a great idea for longer movies, especially those like Oppenheimer and Mission Impossible which were close to 3 hrs in length.

'Karate Kid: Legends' and 'Bring Her Back' have solid debuts, while 'The Phoenician Scheme' opens with the best per-theater average ($93K) of the year.	"https://preview.redd.it/di3ho2tpgl4f1.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=186eb2a8aa82274d3e409f1cbf80eb70969bb9d5

Without much competition this weekend, ***Lilo &amp; Stitch*** and ***Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning*** kept the top two spots, even though both had rough drops. ***Karate Kid: Legends*** had an okay debut, even if it was less than half of the 2010 film. ***Bring Her Back*** was also off to a solid start. The weekend's story, however, was Wes Anderson's ***The Phoenician Scheme***, which earned the year's best per-theater average in 6 theaters.

The Top 10 earned a combined $144.8 million this weekend. That's up a massive 140% from last year, when ***The Garfield Movie*** topped the box office.

Disney's ***Lilo &amp; Stitch*** stayed on top this weekend, adding $61.8 million this weekend. That's a rough 58% drop, which is a little worse than ***The Little Mermaid*** (56.7%). But that film had a megahit, ***Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse***, opening on its second weekend. Which makes ***Lilo &amp; Stitch***'s drop look worse.

Through 10 days, the film has made $278.9 million domestically. It already passed the original's lifetime ($145 million) last week, and it will eclipse its adjusted total ($283.7 million) today. Last week, I said that the film should easily gross past $500 million domestically. But based on this drop and family competition like ***How to Train Your Dragon*** coming up, there's a possibility that it misses that milestone. It will all depend on the next few weeks.

Staying in second place, ***Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning*** added $27.1 million this weekend. That's a rough 57% drop. That's better than ***Dead Reckoning*** (64.6%), but it's still the second worst drop in the franchise. And that's despite the film keeping IMAX formats this weekend.

Through 10 days, the film has amassed $122.5 million. On Friday, it became Cruise's 21st film as leading star to hit $100 million milestone. The film is currently running ahead of ***Dead Reckoning***, but it's gonna have some tough competition coming up. Right now, it's very likely that ***The Final Reckoning*** misses $200 million domestically.

In third place, ***Karate Kid: Legends*** debuted with $20.3 million in 3,809 theaters. For reference, the 2010 version debuted with $55.6 million. Adjusted for inflation, this debut is barely ahead of the first film ($15.5 million), but lower than the second ($37 million) and third ($26.8 million).

The film cost just $45 million, so it's not really a failure. But it still feels like the film could've opened far higher than this. After all, the 2010 film was a huge hit and the franchise has stayed relevant with newer generations thanks to the series ***Cobra Kai***. So how did it open with barely $20 million? Well, competition with ***Lilo &amp; Stitch*** didn't help, as families are prioritizing that film over ***Legends***.

Perhaps ***Cobra Kai*** was both its biggest strength and disadvantage. It kept audiences glued to the franchise, but in the process, it also made them picky over whether to pay a ticket price to watch this film in theaters. Maybe the ***Karate Kid*** franchise is now relegated to streaming? Cause even if getting Jackie Chan and Ralph Macchio back didn't propel much interest for this, then who knows what will. 

According to Sony, 59% of the audience was male, and 67% of the audience was 25 and over. While critics were mixed, the audience was a little more forgiving: they gave it a fine ""A–"" on CinemaScore. Regardless, there's tough family competition on its way with ***How to Train Your Dragon*** and ***Elio***. For now, it's very likely ***Karate Kid: Legends*** finishes with less than $60 million domestically. Whatever Sony has planned for the future of the franchise, that's up to anyone's guess.

In fourth place, ***Final Destination: Bloodlines*** dropped 44%, earning $10.9 million this weekend. The film has earned $111.8 million so far, and it looks like it will finish with around $140 million domestically.

In fifth place, A24's ***Bring Her Back*** debuted with $7 million in 2,449 theaters. That's not far off from ***Talk to Me*** ($10.4 million), and it was in the top 10 biggest debuts for the studio.

A24 banked on the film solely on its directors, Danny and Michael Philippou, after seeing how big ***Talk to Me*** was back in 2023. All in all, this is a solid start. A24 financed the film for around $20 million, with foreign rights sold going to Sony for around $13 million. As for why the film debuted much lower than ***Talk to Me***? Simply put, there's some competition for horror right now. ***Final Destination: Bloodlines*** over-performed projections, ***Sinners*** is still going strong, and ***28 Years Later*** is coming up in a few weeks. Basically, it's tough to ask for much better numbers. Especially considering how the film is incredibly bleak.

According to A24, 57% of the audience was male, and 70% were 25 and over. They gave it a solid ""B+"" on CinemaScore, which is the same grade as ***Talk to Me***. That's impressive, considering how bleak this film was. There's some competition coming up, but ***Bring Her Back*** should still get to over $20 million by the end of its run.

In sixth place, ***Sinners*** has yet to post a single bad drop. And this weekend won't be the first bad drop. It eased just 39%, adding $5.2 million this weekend. The film has earned $267.1 million so far, and it should get close to $290 million domestically. Incredible. Simply incredible.

Well, it happened, pals. ***Thunderbolts*** is now losing to ***Sinners*** on weekends, and it's unlikely it will take the lead ever again. The film dropped a rough 51%, earning $4.7 million this weekend. The film's domestic total stands at $181.8 million, which is $4 million behind ***Captain America: Brave New World*** through the same point. Right now, it looks like the film will finish with around $195 million. Ouch.

A24's ***Friendship*** added 238 theaters this weekend, although the film fell 51%, earning $2.5 million this weekend. The film has now earned $12.3 million so far. The film has performed very well so far, but it's clear there's a ceiling to its box office prospects.

In ninth place, Angel Studios' ***The Last Rodeo*** collapsed 60%, earning $2.1 million this weekend. The film has earned $10.7 million on its first 10 days, and it looks like it won't earn much higher than $15 million.

Rounding up the Top 10 was ***J-Hope Tour: Hope on Stage***, which earned $939,173 in 631 theaters. Not bad, considering this was a live concert.

Focus Features released Wes Anderson's ***The Phoenician Scheme*** in 6 theaters, where it earned $560,499 this weekend. That's an incredible $93,417 per-theater average, which is the best of the year so far. Focus went all out on the limited rollout; the film played on all six screens at the Angelika Film Center in New York. It included a jazz band and film-themed merchandise and activations in the lobby and concessions, with higher ticket prices ($30 for standard and $60 for premium).  The film will expand into 1,500 theaters this weekend.

#**OVERSEAS**

***Lilo &amp; Stitch*** was still #1 in the rest of the world. It added $113.1 million overseas, taking its worldwide numbers to $609.6 million. Its best markets are Mexico ($45.9M), UK ($34.5M), France ($23.1M), Brazil ($21.6M) and Germany ($18.1M). It's still set to finish with over $1 billion worldwide.

***Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning*** added $76.1 million overseas, for a $353.7 million worldwide total. It opened in China this weekend, earning $25.2 million this weekend. Its best markets are China ($25.2M), the UK ($22.3M), Japan ($18.5M), Korea ($17M) and France ($14.2M). The film is definitely hitting $550 million worldwide, and it could get close to $600 million depending on its drops.

***Final Destination: Bloodlines*** is still going strong, adding $14.4 million overseas, for a $230 million worldwide total. The best markets are the UK ($12.5M), Mexico ($11.2M), India ($7.6M), Philippines ($6.9M) and France ($6.7M). The film is gonna finish with close to $300 million worldwide.

***Karate Kid: Legends*** made its debut in more markets, after starting playing in Latin America a few weeks ago. It earned $12 million overseas, taking its worldwide total to $46.3 million. It had fine debuts in the UK ($3.4M) and Germany ($2.2M). There are still some more markets left, so we'll keep an eye on this one.

#**FILMS THAT ENDED THEIR RUN THIS WEEK**

Movie | Release Date | Studio | Domestic Opening | Domestic Total | Worldwide Total | Budget |
----------|----------|----------|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:
*Until Dawn* | Apr/25 | Sony | $8,003,402 | $20,174,192 | $51,515,949 | $15M

- Sony's ***Until Dawn*** has closed with $51 million worldwide. Pretty solid against its small $51 million, and despite mixed reviews. Not to mention the poor comparisons to the game, given that the film was considered an underwhelming adaptation of the game (director David F. Sandberg said it was more of a new installment rather than a full remake). But hey, it worked, I guess.

#**THIS WEEKEND**

We've got a new wide release this weekend, though it remains a question mark if it will be strong enough to dethrone ***Stitch***.

That's Lionsgate's ***Ballerina*** (no, we ain't including that long ass title), a *John Wick* spin-off set between the events of the third and fourth films. It stars Ana de Armas as a ballerina-assassin who begins to train in the assassin traditions of the Ruska Roma and sets out to exact revenge for her father's death. Lionsgate has emphasized that Keanu Reeves is part of the film, putting him in all trailers and posters (even if his role is far smaller). The film underwent a very troubling production; it had 2-3 months of reshoots, refilming the majority of the film. The film is directed by Len Wiseman, but the reshoots were helmed by Chad Stahelski, with Wiseman not present on set. Will this save the film?

And as previously mentioned, ***The Phoenician Scheme*** is hitting wide release this weekend. It's set for around 1,500 theaters, how close will it get to ***Asteroid City***'s wide debut ($9M)?

In limited release, Neon is releasing Mike Flanagan's ***The Life of Chuck***. Based on the 2020 novella by Stephen King, it stars Tom Hiddleston, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Karen Gillan, Jacob Tremblay, and Mark Hamill. It surprised many when it won the People's Choice Award at the Toronto Film Festival, as every winner since 2012 has always been nominated for an Oscar for Best Picture. Will it surprise?

mi7	TrueFilm	1kx0aq8	1748383466	How Tom Cruise helped curate the Last Movie Star Ethos	"I saw Final Reckoning yesterday, and was amazed when the crowd clapped throughout the film. I’m not just talking at the beginning or end, but a good 5-6 applause moments throughout.

This made the screening very fun, but also perplexed me. I understand Tom Cruise is a beloved actor, but this kind of devotion from a general moviegoing audience? 

Then I checked social media. Cruise was everywhere, including on more youth-oriented accounts such as the Barstool film page, on meme accounts, and even his own Instagram was very active. Pretty standard stuff for film marketing, but combined with the billboards around LA of just Cruise’s head in grayscale, I began to think of Cruise as an entity rather than an actor.

Cruise is one of the more interesting celebrities I can think of in terms of his polarization. He is almost universally praised for his acting, his movies consistently do better than most stars, and he’s shown the ability to carry action-epics or indie dramas. In recent years he’s become a legitimate all-time stunt-man, often milking this side of himself for the marketing of each new film.

Yet at the same time, there’s the Scientology.

You only have to go back a decade or two to see how fragile his public image was. There was a time post-divorce and the Oprah incident that the public was fairly weary of Cruise and his ties to Scientology. As one of the religious group’s most famous and vocal devotees, his ideologies began to clash with the public’s own perception of the star.

Then the pandemic came, and the fall of moviegoing.

Famously leaked during the filming of Dead Reckoning, Cruise berated his crew for not complying with the Pandemic’s set-safety policies. His main point was that the industry was counting on this movie to work. Without MI and Cruise in general, the industry would not pull through this period.

Was he right? Possibly. 

It’s true that the industry has been markedly down since Pre-Pandemic levels, and Cruise’s films have mostly bucked this trend. Arguably most impressively, Top Gun: Maverick was a smash hit like few others, further proving Cruise’s star power. 

But it’s not just that it’s Cruise. It’s what audiences have come to expect from Cruise. When you see a movie of his, you know you’re in for practical effects, epic stunts, and Cruise playing a version of himself that is easily digestible.

It’s a far-cry from his early work in the 80’s and 90’s when the star was in more award-tailored films and he seemed to be targeting the great directors (PTA, Kubrick, Scorsese, Spielberg, etc).

By comparison now, he almost exclusively works with Mcquarrie, who seems to share a short hand with him. Any film that stepped out of this mold (The Mummy and American Made, both from 2017) were not successful at the box office and divisive among critics. Since then, Cruise has only worked on Top Gun / MI franchises.

And in the wake of the Pandemic, the Last Movie Star has begun to circulate around Cruise. 

It’s interesting to me that the public has mostly forgiven his Scientology-ties and instead are championing him as a hero of film, the last hope for theaters to survive the age of streaming and home-lockdowns.

Cruise himself has leaned into this new title as well, going back to that leaked outburst during the Dead Reckoning filming. It seems as though Cruise is hyper-aware of this position he is in, and has spent the last ten years working only on large-scale, action oriented films to try and bring people back to theaters. 

The plot of the latest MI movie quite literally pits Cruise against the newest Boogyman of the entertainment industry, AI, to which Cruise conquers through comradery, practical effects and stunt work, and a whole lot of running. All the side characters consistently tout Cruise’s character as “earths best chance at salvation” (paraphrasing).

You can see it as admirable, self-effacing, or more realistically as a mix of both. But in any regard, Cruise successfully regained his image and positioned himself at the top of the industry.

His upcoming film slate seems to show a return to the more dramatic roles of his past, notably including a collaboration with Inarritu. It will be interesting to see if this shift from the action films will bring the same types of audiences, or if another star will take up the mantle of Do-It-All performance. 

One thing’s for sure: there’s only ever been one, and probably will never be, another Cruise."	/r/TrueFilm/comments/1kx0aq8/how_tom_cruise_helped_curate_the_last_movie_star/	https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/1kx0aq8/how_tom_cruise_helped_curate_the_last_movie_star/

mi7	movies	1ksqtqz	1747920824	Tom Cruise is one of/ if not the greatest “movie star” of all time	"I feel like Tom Cruise basically saved the movie theater business with Top Gun: Maverick. I remember the talk around COVID that a lot of movie theaters were dying and may go the way of the Dodo bird. The first movie I saw post COVID was Top Gun and it felt like a cultural event that everyone was on board with. There are (obviously) much better actors out there but I don’t think we will ever see a movie star who commits so much physical effort to entertain people. Looking over his filmography it’s hard to dispute the Box Office numbers he’s put out. The only other actor who is in the same category of “movie star” instead of “actor” is Will Smith. 

I know the other Tom (Hanks) has had just as much success but I view him as an actor instead of the aforementioned Movie Star. I’m sure some of y’all probably disagree but in light of the 17th mission impossible movie coming out (which I probably won’t watch in theaters) I felt like Tom Cruise deserves a little recognition… even if it’s just a dumb goober on Reddit. 

Edit: I swear sometimes Reddit has brain rot, I think it isn’t a moral failing to separate art from the artist. I didn’t expect to be bombarded about Scientology (that’s on me) when I wrote the post. Art and artist can be separated.

By paying the admission cost to see a film or renting a movie from Apple I am not condoning anything that anyone associated with the film has done or will do in the future. Anything in their lives that isn’t directly associated with the making of the movie isn’t endorsed by my viewing of it. It’s not just Tom Cruise involved in any of his projects and in turn all of the folks that it takes to make a movie. Movies are escapism and for a little while I get to go on the Adventure or fall in love. I bought the ticket and I’ll take the ride. 

I’m not saying the man is my moral compass and I don’t particularly care for him as a person but he is one of the biggest movie stars to ever walk this earth. He’s good at making pure escapism movies for the masses."	/r/movies/comments/1ksqtqz/tom_cruise_is_one_of_if_not_the_greatest_movie/	https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1ksqtqz/tom_cruise_is_one_of_if_not_the_greatest_movie/

To fit into said chamber. Cruise rips open his undersea diving suit and proceeds to exist at 500 feet below the ocean surface in just his boxers. The pressure at such a depth is \~15atm, his unprotected body would be severely compressed, with time to death estimated to be less than a minute. And in this time he was expected to swim up 500 feet. In the movie they simply cut to scenes of him having muscle convulsions near the ocean surface. I know this is super nit-picky, but it broke my immersion from an otherwise action-packed movie.	/r/movies/comments/1kqykqq/undersea_scene_in_mission_impossible_the_final/	https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1kqykqq/undersea_scene_in_mission_impossible_the_final/

""Movie can be watched on it's own, but needs other movies for the full experience. It references [movie], [character who appears in show], [show]. Watch [show], [movie] to experience the big important scenes. Watch [all marvel movies] for the ultimate experience.""

Cause I am curious if I should rewatch the Final Destination and Mission Impossible movies heading into next week/two, and I just realized that this thing is happening too often so...is there a site like this??

(also if someone can tell me if the new M:I movie should be watched after entire franchise or just teh last movie/ and if someone can tell me if Final Destination:Bloodlines is a standalone, that would be great)"	/r/movies/comments/1kmwk64/is_there_a_website_that_tells_you_if_a_certain/	https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1kmwk64/is_there_a_website_that_tells_you_if_a_certain/
mi7	movies	1km734b	1747199011	What makes a good remake of a movie? Time? Quality? Execution? A not-so-popular or flopped original Idea/movie, if given another chance? Story? Improve the Story? Make it your own?	"If you want the simple TL:DR explanation.

***It will ultimately depend on the movie and the behind-the-scenes, and it depends on you and how you see it. If you're a casual or neutral, in the end, good or bad movie, done, life moves on. end of discussion.***

If you want details or want to see my observation.

(Hopefully I keep it simply explained, straight to the point but with some complexity, because I tend to yap, overthink, and overexplain. Like what I'm doing in this paragraph)

I'm basing this also on my basic observation of people's reaction (casual, critics, and cinephiles) I'll call it 3C (and yes, it references 3C films on YT)

I had this thought because I remembered watching the movie, 1988's ""The Blob""  
(That spooked me when I was a kid)

But learned years later it was a remake of a 1958 film of the same name.  
(Believe it or not, Steve McQueen was there)

And learned other remakes aren't popular IPs that had movies before.

# Time:

The Nutty Professor (Eddie Murphy) (1996) - The Nutty Professor (Jerry Lewis) (1963)

Death Race (Jason Statham) (2008) - Death Race (1975)

Ocean's Eleven (2001) - Ocean's 11 (1960) (Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr., what a cast)

The Parent Trap (Lindsay Lohan) (1988) - The Parent Trap (1961)

***""You get the point.""***

I think most 3C will welcome a remake if they don't know it was a remake in the first place. Because so much time has passed since the original. And with time comes more creativity, or advancement in filming technology, or the remake was able to stand on its own. I also think eras play a part (ex., a joke in the 70s won't work in the 2020s)

Disney, though, at first it was welcoming, but it grew suspicious that Disney keeps going for live action remakes instead of being original, because business-wise, it makes money, until Snow White. To be fair, there are good and bad remakes, but it ultimately depends on you, the viewer.

# Execution:

**Story, Improve Story, Quality, or Make it your own.**

It's either these 4 (for now, that I can think of)

***(Story).***

The remake is a beat-for-beat the same of the original movie (ex,. The Lion King 2019)

Or does something 90% different (Maleficent or Cruella) ***(I think this part should be at the ""Make it your own"" category, but I'm not sure)***

***(Improve The Story)***

Same Story but added more elements, whatever that may be (ex., Aladdin 2019)

***(Quality)***

The Story is so good it doesn't need a remake (Back to the Future trilogy). I think I'm cheating here.

Or a movie back then was so good, let's remake it for this generation!

(Though I wonder why not rerelease it, then I remember the example I gave that maybe the content, jokes, etc, won't work in this generation, but I digress)

***(Make it your own)***

Tom Cruise's Mission Impossible (was originally a TV series in the 60's)

# Current Opinion/s or Debate/s

Whenever we hear the news, a remake of this ""Popular IP""

A lot of people will say, *""Hollywood is running out of ideas,""* or *""Hollywood ain't doing anything original anymore.""*

Which is true, but we have to admit original ideas are a hit or miss, and it's sometimes our fault, and mine too. But that's a different discussion that some YouTuber has already talked about.

I saw someone comment this, not 100%, but it's something like *""Why not remake bad movies?""* I want to add ""*How about not popular IPs?""* (Though I think books answer that)

Which is why I add here ""Flopped original Idea/movie if given another chance"" because I don't know any movie that was remade from a failed idea.

I believe there is more to expand from this discussion, so please, share your thoughts!"	/r/movies/comments/1km734b/what_makes_a_good_remake_of_a_movie_time_quality/	https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1km734b/what_makes_a_good_remake_of_a_movie_time_quality/

mi7	movies	1k7kl56	1745586718	I rewatched all of Tom Cruise’s films from Endless Love (1981) to Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning (2023) and ranked the 295 running moments in his filmography.	"Earlier this year, in anticipation of the release of [*Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning*](https://youtu.be/fsQgc9pCyDU), I decided to rank all of Tom Cruise’s running scenes in the *M:I* franchise. I’d worked on several *M:*I data pieces for various companies and figured it would be easy to rank the 100ish running moments. When the list was completed - it felt incomplete, so I decided to rank all of the running scenes in his filmography. Starting with 1981’s *Endless Love*, and finishing with 2023's *Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning*. Cruise had gone to extreme lengths for his films, so I decided to honor his hard work by putting together this absurd list.

**Quick note** \- His X handle always makes me laugh

https://preview.redd.it/nipy05v8czwe1.png?width=762&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=98ad8d85fd8050287ab4770953933c0844f559f1

Here’s what you need to know about the list:

* I found and ranked 295 moments 
* I counted running, sprinting and jogging. The amount of time doesn’t matter either. In *Top Gun* there’s a one-second shot of [him running to hit a volleyball](https://youtu.be/okyLAKclleo). It was included. 
* A short blurb was included for list items 295 - 26
* Timestamps have been included for the top 25. Some of the timestamps may be a little off for you. It depends on where/how you watch the movies. For me, it was a mixture of DVDs, Blu-rays, Vudu and streaming channels. 
* I researched the top 10 scenes and wrote more about them (and included YouTube links)
* This list is obviously subjective, but after going through Cruise’s filmography for the fourth time since 2018, I am very happy with the top 10
* There is zero chance that our lists will match up, so don’t be surprised if the 295 moments don’t line up with your list. 
* For some of the scenes, I split them up into moments. I just went with the flow of the scene and if he stops for a moment or the scene cuts to someone else - I split up the running moment into parts. 
* If you’re interested in learning more about the top 10 and this list, I recorded a podcast episode about the  data collection and ranking process. It’s fun. You should listen to it. The podcast is called [*Movies, Films and Flix*](https://www.spreaker.com/episode/bonus-episode-the-tom-cruise-running-special--65723787) \- you can find it wherever you listen to podcasts. I also have a show called *Deep Blue Sea - The Podcast* that you should listen to as well.

**Top 25!**



25. *Collateral* \- Subway running followed by a beautiful jump - Dude is pissed. - 01:46:10

24. *The Mummy* \- “Slip in, slip out. Just like we always do.” Then it cuts to them being shot at whilst running away. - 00:10:15

23. *Mission: Impossible - Fallout* \- Keep going straight? - He runs into an office building and smashes a window. 01:34:53

22. *Mission: Impossible - Fallout* \- Why is he running in a circle? Great overhead shot of cruise sprinting up stairs, losing the goons, and running around the upper floors of the cathedral. - 01:32:59

21. *Mission: Impossible - Fallout* \- Roof running and two amazing jumps. - 01:33:48

20. *Mission: Impossible - Fallout* \- During the bathroom fight Hunt runs at a guy and slams him through a wall. Great stuff. I love how he really doesn’t want to do it. - 00:32:38

19. *Minority Repor*t - Runs up to the house and has to stop a potential murder. - 00:15:28:00

18. *Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol* \- Runs away from the Burj Khalifa - Looks awesome. Brad Bird shoots it from every angle. I love how the camera looks up at him.

17. *Mission: Impossible - Fallout* \- “Ethan he’s getting away from you, you’re going to have to go faster! - Cruise absolutely books it during a roof run that ends with the jump that broke his foot. Epic. - 01:34:20

16. *Jerry Maguire* \- Airport running. - 02:06:05

15. *Mission: Impossible II* \- He runs in slow motion so he can jump out of a building - Wonderful - 01:25:58 - He also runs while holding two guns (and shooting them at the same time). Awesome hair work

14. *Risky Business* \- He takes a drunk guy out of a train and runs back into it. - 01:20:45 

13. *Days of Thunder* \- He races Robert Duvall - It’s a good time. 01:42:54

12. *War of the Worlds* \- Cruise runs away from the aliens. Amazing scene. - The aliens are silly for thinking they can blow Cruise up. Dude has ash all over his face. - 00:26:29

11. *Collateral* \- Runs out of a hospital and across an overpass. When he starts running I don’t think he'll ever look faster on screen. - 00:52:25

  


**10.** ***Edge of Tomorrow*** \- “Arrest this man.” - In an all-timer Cruise moment, he tries to escape arrest and It ends badly - 00:07:58 - [YouTube Clip](https://youtu.be/EO4Mt9DDV-Q) 

Moments before Brendan Gleeson’s character yells “Arrest this man,” Tom Cruise delivers an all-timer Cruise moment in which this dialogue is delivered:

“I just inspired millions of people to join your army. And when the body bags come home and they’re looking for someone to blame, how hard do you think it would be for me to convince people to blame you? I’d imagine the general would prefer to avoid that.”

Cruise enters Gleeson’s office with total confidence and he quickly becomes a slimy rat whose escape attempt ends quickly. It’s perfect and it makes his heroic transformation more interesting. Director Doug Liman did a great job weaponizing Cruise’s charm in this scene, and It’s fun watching a guy who can’t escape an office building becoming a world-saving soldier.



**9.** ***The Firm*** \- The final chase scene. He runs, jumps, goes up steps and this is when we get to see his true breakaway speed AND he’s holding a briefcase. 02:12:23 - [YouTube Clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0vCzkK_AJ0&amp;pp=ygUUVGhlIGZpcm0gY2hhc2Ugc2NlbmU%3D) 

*The Firm* is Cruise’s first film to fully showcase his soon-to-be-famous running form (elbows and knees). We get a glimpse of it at the 68-minute mark when he’s chasing down Jeannie Tripplehorn. But, it’s not until the climactic chase that we see his breakaway speed for several minutes as he’s running away from Tobin “Jigsaw” Bell. 



**8.** ***Far and Away*** \- In a neat transition,  Cruise starts running so fast that the next shot is of an explosion. Talk about explosive running.  01:40:13 - [YouTube Clip](https://youtu.be/NajSnF9AspA) 

I love how Ron Howard cuts from a sprinting Tom Cruise to an explosion. It’s silly and it always puts a smile on my face. I also love that the movie ends with the Land Run of 1893. 



**7.** ***Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation*** \- Cruise wipes out while trying to jump over a car. It is very funny and the MI score helps make it better - 01:12:58 - [YouTube Clip](https://youtu.be/WK8X6m_wEbg) 

“This is *Mission: Impossible*, I can’t just cross a street and get in a car.” - McQuarrie talking about a conversation he had with Cruise on the *Rogue Nation* commentary. 

When putting together the top 10 I always knew that this three-second moment would be included. It’s a silly moment punctuated by cheeky musical accompaniment and it proves that Cruise doesn’t take himself seriously. It’s made even better by the knowledge that Cruise came up with this bit on the day and he surprised the crew with his ill-fated car jump. Also, the ensuing dialogue (What are you talking about?) is delightful. At this point in his career, Cruise was on a hot streak and it’s fun knowing that he was still totally down to make himself look like a dork.  



**6.** ***Mission: Impossible - Fallout*** \- Iconic run across the building punctuated by a beautiful tracking shot - Dude looks amazing and he almost catches Cavill - 01:36:25 - [YouTube Clip](https://youtu.be/Sjn3ELLcy2U)

“I loved doing this, but it hurt.” - Tom Cruise - *Fallout* Blu-ray commentary. 

Watching Cruise run across The Blackfriars Railway bridge is an all-timer Cruise moment for multiple reasons. 

* It looks great and is a perfect trailer moment
* “I’m jumping out of a window.” - Great line - I love the reaction he gets from the people in the office. They 
* Tom was still recovering from the ankle break he suffered during a jump gone awry
* Director Christopher McQuarrie said - “He was going for it.”
* The score rules
* It’s a bit gratuitous but the running makes sense in regards to the story.



**5**. ***Mission: Impossible*** \- Cruise runs from an exploding restaurant and does his first “I look awesome while running in an action film” work. - 31:59 - Lots of fish die….. [YouTube Clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8HHeT4Eo6A&amp;pp=ygUiTWlzc2lvbiBpbXBvc3NpYmxlIGZpc2ggcmVzdGF1cmFudNIHCQl-CQGHKiGM7w%3D%3D)

That one was particularly very crazy - Talking about the scene on The Graham Norton Show

Tom Cruise was already a big star in 1996, but this moment made him a gigantic “action movie” star. He had been in *Top Gun* (sitting in a plane), *Legend* (lots of rolling and crouch running), Days of Thunder (*more sitting*), Far and Away (*boxing*), and *The Outsiders* (fisticuffs), but *Mission: Impossible* saw him entering a new phase of his career. This moment was everywhere in 1996 and it’s one of the most iconic images of the *Mission: Impossible* franchise. It gets added points because the stunt looks legitimately dangerous and features some solid arm work from Tom. 



**4.** ***Risky Business*** \- A cigarette-smoking Cruise (wearing sunglasses at night) runs up to some teenagers while the song “Mannish Boy” plays on the soundtrack This is the moment when Cruise became Tom Cruise - 01:07:26 - [YouTube Clip](https://youtu.be/adZvM19Qnb0) (starts at 53 seconds)

Wearing a suit coat, black shirt, black sunglasses and puffing on a cigarette, Cruise is strutting down the street and runs up to a group of classmates. The moment lasts only seven seconds,  but it’s a turning point for Cruise. Also, the song selection is perfect. 



**3.** ***Vanilla Sky*** \- Cruise runs through an empty Times Square - 00:03:37 - [YouTube Clip](https://youtu.be/-kNdNC-2wPU)

The groundwork for the Times Square running in *Vanilla Sky* was set up in the 1996 film *Jerry Maguire*. In the Cameron Crowe-directed movie, Cruise dramatically runs through an airport -  and it looks great. Years later, while filming *Vanilla Sky*, Crowe and Cruise pulled some strings with the city of New York and were able to close down Times Square for three hours on a Sunday morning in November. The idea was that Cruise’s character hates being alone, and he dreams that he’s alone in one of the busiest places in the world. It’s total vanity, but I love that Cruise has a running scene in an empty Times Square. 



**2.** ***Collateral*** \- He throws a chair through a glass window, then WIPES out on the chair and just keeps running. It’s his most aggressive running ever. - 01:44:50 -[ YouTube Clip (starts at 2:37)](https://youtu.be/_pTzb4rl5Y8)

*Collatera*l not only features the best sitting performance of Tom Cruise’s career, it also features his most aggressive running. Tom’s character Vincent is a straight-up killer and it’s fun watching Cruise as he fully commits to being a coyote who chases down his prey with lightning-fast footwork. There’s a moment towards the end when Vincent is chasing down Max and Annie (Jada Pinkett Smith - running in heels), and he takes a chair to smash a window so he can run through it. However, Cruise mistimed/misjudged the chair’s trajectory and he WIPED out on the chair and fell to the ground. The neat thing is that he springs up immediately and keeps running. It’s a perfect showcase for Cruise’s tenacity and toughness and I love that the unplanned moment made its way into the film - and so does Mann who felt like it added to the realism of *Collateral*. It’s a seconds-long moment, but I love that nothing can stop Cruise from running. 



**1.** ***Mission: Impossible III*** \- Cruise runs across some rooftops and then he SPRINTS through a Shanghai fishing village - 01:44:10 - [YouTube Clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOqV-jDl0h8&amp;pp=ygUhbWlzc2lvbiBpbXBvc3NpYmxlIDMgc2hhbmdoYWkgcnVu0gcJCX4JAYcqIYzv)

In 2006, Cruise had been running in movies for 20+ years and had some memorable sprints in *War of the Worlds, The Firm, Minority Report, Collatera*l, and *Far and Away*. However, his sprinting in *M:I 3* (which took 6-7 takes to get perfect) made people sit up and realize they were witnessing cinematic running history. It’s the fastest Cruise has ever looked, and the spidercam rig that was built for the scene works perfectly as it tracks alongside Cruise as he damn near goes plaid on the Shanghai sidewalks. During the Blu-ray commentary, director J.J. Abrams says “I loved watching you run” to Cruise, and I totally agree. It’s apex Tom Cruise running.

mi7	movies	1jvu1q9	1744278517	Mission Impossible 2 - thoughts?	"Working our way throught the Mission Impossible franchise, as the last (?) one is coming out soon, and good grief is MI2 bad. The jump in quality between MI2 and MI3 might as well be the grand canyon.

Possibly what makes it even more cringy for me, as an Australian, is the Sydney backdrop. It looks completely pedestrian to me - Sydney harbour, Dougray Scott's house, the horse-races, the island handover, the cars... None of it had the luxury, ""exotic locale"" vibe they usually go for.

What did non-Australians think of it, at least in that regard? Do you feel similarly about movies that highlight American locales?"	/r/movies/comments/1jvu1q9/mission_impossible_2_thoughts/	https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1jvu1q9/mission_impossible_2_thoughts/
mi7	movies	1jm7sow	1743201692	Greatest obstacle/danger sequence in an action film? Not a fight, but a sequence avoiding danger	"Hi guys, we've all seen the incredible ""bridge is out!"" scene in True Lies, where Jamie Lee Curtis is in an out-of-control limo (driver is dead) and sticking out of the sunroof while Arnold is hanging above her from a helicopter, trying to clasp hands before she reaches the gap in the bridge. 

When she finally does, and the limo goes flying below her into the water, it's exhilirating. 

Does anyone else know of any other such sequences in action films that are as intense and fun as this? I'm not talking about a fight scene, but rather a scene like this. (The one of Tom Cruise saving Henry Cavill from splatting when skydiving in Mission Impossible Fallout also comes to mind as a good example.)

Thanks"	/r/movies/comments/1jm7sow/greatest_obstacledanger_sequence_in_an_action/	https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1jm7sow/greatest_obstacledanger_sequence_in_an_action/
mi7	TrueFilm	1jigry0	1742784025	"I truly believe that a new genre of film has been created, and it should be called ""stream"" in the same way we have ""horror"" ""drama"" etc"	"I watched some movies in a row recently.

""Smile 2""

""The Monkey""

""Mickey 17""

""The Electric State""

""Presence""

""Companion""

First of all these movies are terrible and instantly forgettable. And I want to quickly add that ""The Electric State"" is one of the dumbest films I have ever seen, and the Russo brothers have shown themselves to be literal one trick ponies... They use the same composer as they did in Avengers Infinity War and End Game, and use 90% of the same score and action techniques. It's literally jarring to watch, especially with Chris Pratt. Almost like watching an action film reuse the score from Mission Impossible but *slightly* altered. Also Millie Bobby Brown looks like a porn star. She's supposed to be playing a high schooler... but you can obviously tell she's had an enormous amount of work done on her face, and her lips have been injected to the point where she looks like a blow up sex doll. It's absurd.

Anyways... Modern movies no longer contain ""purity of essence"". Many of them aren't individual genres anymore, but rather 3+ genres smashed together, and I believe that this creates a new genre called ""streaming"", in that it's designed for you to click on it and watch it as long as possible, or just leave it on in the background while you do something else.

It's important to note that streaming services justify their existence and the salaries of their CEOs and high ranking management by MINUTES VIEWED. Yes, when they pitch to investors and shareholders, their only metric is by how much content is watched. This means that content doesn't have to be good or impactful, it literally just needs you to WATCH for as long as possible.

The problem with genre films is that they require you to pay attention to them. You can't just hop in and out of single genre films while washing dishes or folding laundry because their strength and PURPOSE is to build in intensity towards a climax. Even with action films like James Bond, you need to pay attention to know what's going on.

I will use smile 2 and ""the monkey"" as examples. Neither of these are horror films. They are Comedy, Drama, Horror films mashed together. They are NOT scary in the slightest (because a lot of people don't like scary films which translates to LESS VIEWING TIME). Smile 2 is so stupid because it attempts to be a drama, but none of the ""dramatic"" scenes have any weight to them because you're aware that there's some dumbass smile demon causing all the problems, so when the characters act their hearts out to each other with intense drama, it's like ""why the fuck am I watching this nonsense"".

The Monkey is even stranger. This movie feels schizophrenic, it literally cycles between something mildly scary (again, can't be too scary or less minutes watched), something absurdly comical meant to be funny, some kind of ""drama"" moment, and starts over again. It literally builds to nothing and just ends.

These films are not films as we understand them. They are meant to be viewed without full attention, because Netflix needs people to watch things in the background. In fact, their OWN numbers show that **people watch stuff in the background almost as much as they watch on their couch**, which is crazy because to investors and share holders, a minute watched is a minute watched so Netflix wants content you just put on all day. 

Then you watch something like Electric State which is... a coming of age drama, mixed with some sci-fi thriller elements, mixed with LITERALLY AVENGERS-ESQUE fight scenes that use the same action shots and score from Avengers... Like... Really???

These modern movies are truly so stupid and there is no point to them. If you watch blockbusters from the 90s-2000s, sure, they are also quite dumb but at least they require some degree of attention and lead to something. Modern films have NO PURPOSE except to get you to turn on netflix and have it on in the background.

Has anyone else noticed this? I really do think this is an interesting phenomenon that is worth discussing."	/r/TrueFilm/comments/1jigry0/i_truly_believe_that_a_new_genre_of_film_has_been/	https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/1jigry0/i_truly_believe_that_a_new_genre_of_film_has_been/

mi7	movies	1j0zedl	1740835511	How would Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning (2023) looked like if it had a different plot?	"WARNING - SPOILERS:

I liked the final product but if someone else did it, here's what it look like:

First, in the first act: the opening scene would be inspired by Terminator 2: Judgement Day's opening scene. Then, the usual IMF mission briefing scene happens, then, an another action scene takes place in Paris, France, this time with Ethan Hunt, then after the usual title sequence, the scene explaining about The Entity happens and how it's going to affect the world. Then, there would be a scene in Saudi Arabia setting up with the character of Gabriel controlling his friend using The Entity, acts crazy and Gabriel kills him. In an another scene, Maggie Q's character dies and a funeral is held for her before Ethan has to go on this big mission.

The second act would be set in Rome and Venice. Ethan meets Grace at a café. The Rome car chase remains in place. Then, once the car is hit by a train in the tunnel. Gabriel and his henchmen arrest Ethan and send him to prison. He wakes up in jail unconscious before fighting a group of guard people before IIsa, Benji, Luther and Grace save Ethan. They then go to Venice and even though the entire portion remains in this version, there is a scene where Gabriel will kidnap and kill Ethan if Ethan cuts the power for The Entity to control people and he says that there is an ancient tomb in Egypt that hosts it. IIsa would still die in this version.

The entire third act is set in Egypt and Ethan, Grace and Benji go to an ancient tomb where The Entity's power to control people is in the tomb. Of course, they fight Gabriel and even though Gabriel escapes like the final version, Ethan manages to cut the power off for the Entity to control people but the other half of the Entity is still alive as Ethan, Grace and Benji escape on a plane as the movie then ends. There would also be a bunch of social commentary in this version too about how the Entity is going to take over the whole world.

How do you think of this? Would it be good or not."	/r/movies/comments/1j0zedl/how_would_mission_impossible_dead_reckoning_2023/	https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1j0zedl/how_would_mission_impossible_dead_reckoning_2023/
mi7	movies	1j0avyu	1740758094	Is it strange that my only recent movies I was excited for are stuff like Sonic, John Wick, Mission Impossible, and Monsterverse?	"So I'm a 21 year old guy who doesn't mind going to the movies from time to time and watching films on airplanes (mostly catching up of films I missed when I go on vacation), but I find that I'm not really excited by most films right now mostly because things have been slow since the strike happened and everyone is still trying to get back to work. It also feels after 2020 for the Oscars I barely know much about any of the films unless I know about one movie (last year was Oppenheimer which I eventually watched, this year is Wicked which I have yet to watch) so it doesn't help with bringing any excitement. 

However when I tell people my films that got me excited within the last few years, some find it weird since the responses usually boils down to ""it's just action films with visual flair aimed towards people out of your group"", others think that it's all cool."	/r/movies/comments/1j0avyu/is_it_strange_that_my_only_recent_movies_i_was/	https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1j0avyu/is_it_strange_that_my_only_recent_movies_i_was/

Once I saw the trailer for final reckoning, the trailer blew me away in theaters while I was waiting for some other movie to start. It blew me away so much I had to look it up on YouTube and after coming the conclusion that It was a 8 long running movie series, I just gave it a go eventually.. 

Watched every single movie throughout a week and
Fell in love with the franchise and I loved every single one of them ! I loved the crazy scenes they do, and fallout was actually so insane to watch. I’m so surprised I’ve never heard anybody talk about this series. I’m so happy I’ll be able to watch the movie soon though in may! Genuinely excited for the last movie

mi7	flicks	1ik99x0	1738971665	Mission Impossible 1996	"Decided to revisit the Mission Impossible franchise this weekend and started back at the beginning. I’ve had a few thoughts. 

Considering the blockbuster behemoths the franchise has become it’s kind of wild to go back and watch a Brian DePalma Mission impossible movie. 

Way more star studded than I remember. 

You can kind of tell Ethan having an affair with Jim’s wife was cut. Now it kind of makes them seem like a kind of creepy pair. 

Vanessa Redgrave is amazing. 

I’ll always remember them breaking into the secure vault. 

All in all it’s kind of weird that this was the franchise start when you consider where it all ended up. Last I heard with Covid delays the new Mission Impossible was the most expensive production of all time, something like $560 million. That was not present on the 1996 movie. 

Holds up remarkably well. Def worth a revisit."	/r/flicks/comments/1ik99x0/mission_impossible_1996/	https://www.reddit.com/r/flicks/comments/1ik99x0/mission_impossible_1996/
mi7	movies	1ih3a8i	1738624891	What are your best movie ideas?	"Wether it’s 100% original, or based on something, I’m super curious to know. I am a guy who has a TON of imagination, and if i had unlimited money i would want to make blockbuster movies, cause i have some pretty cool ideas. Making quality movies is SUPER expensive, and i know there are A LOT of people out there with great ideas, but just not the funds to ever do it. 

            My best original ideas would be a movie based in an insane fantasy world, with humans of course, and with a huge medieval style battle at the end. Another one would be about a scientist who creates a time machine and sends a young guy on an island in the Jurassic period. Another one would be a sad movie about depression, a guy who leaves home, trying to find happiness and fame, and the meaning of life, but when his mother dies while he is away, he realizes that he was looking in the wrong places to find happiness. Happy ending movie. 

       Now movies based on stuff, i would do one on the end of times in revelations in the bible, set in a futuristic city. would cost like 500 million to make lol. One based on the game ""Among Us,"" and the plot twist is that NO one was the imposter, but it was a monster hiding in the ship vents. Another one based on a game ""Red dead redemption 2."" It would be about Arthur when he is young. One scary movie based on the game ""Beware."" One on ""Diary of a wimpy kid: the gettaway"" book. One on when Nasa sent the first rover on Mars. An animated movie on the game ""Clash of clans."" A racing movie based on the game ""Forza Horizon,"" where someone is chosen to compete in the biggest road race in history, the Goliath. One based on the 4 part comic book series ""Rust.""

mi7	movies	1hsnebr	1735913760	My thoughts on the many upcoming 2025 movie releases	"I was going to release a list of all the movies I’ve seen this year but that’s been done to death and some guy posted one with like 300 movies he’d seen already. So I thought I’d switch things up. I’m no movie expert, just a guy who loves movies so these are just my opinions. Also I know these are mostly the mainstream movies and more smaller indie films and oscar worthy movies will be announced later.  
   
# JANUARY  
1/10 Den of Thieves 2 - Actually just got around to watching the first one this last year and I enjoyed it. Gerard Butler being the asshole cop was fun and it was cool seeing perspectives from both sides of the heist and having the both sides be sort of morally grey. The ending twist was a little corny though. I have low expectations for this sequel though. I don’t know how you do the film without Pablo Schreiber.  
  
1/17 Wolf Man – I only have hope for this movie because of Leigh Whannel directing it. Sinister and Upgrade are great and the Invisible Man was surprisingly decent. Another movie in that same vein. Plus Christopher Abbott was an actor who I recently discovered and he was great in On the Count of Ten. Highly recommend checking out that small film if you have not seen it yet. On a side note I have heard grumblings of what the wolfman will actually look like in the film and it’s interesting..  
  
1/17 Back in Action – Typical Netflix slop. Although I do enjoy Jamie Foxx and it is good to see Cameron Diaz back out of retirement.  
  
1/17 Presence – Steven Soderbergh is back with his insane clip of punching out films. A ghost story from the perspective of the ghost. I’m expecting this to be very artsy and not make much sense but an interesting concept to say the least.  
  
1/24 Flight Risk – Okay I know Mark Wahlberg is not the greatest actor of all time. But it looks fun. Plus bald Marky Mark is funny to me.  
  
1/30 You’re Cordially Invited – I love Will Ferrell but the jokes did not land with me in the trailer.  
  
1/31 – Companion – My most anticipated release of “Fuck you it’s January.” Jack Quaid is good. The gorgeous Sophie Hatcher is in this. She was good in Heretic and Yellowjackets. Plus the trailer didn’t tell me shit about the movie aside from creepy vibes. Why can’t more trailers be like this?!  
  
1/31 Love Me – This just looks bizarre. I like Steven Yuen. It’s at least creative to say the least.  
  
# FEBRUARY  
2/7 Love Hurts – Only on my radar because I’m all for the Ke Huy Quan renaissance.  
  
2/14 The Gorge – Okay this looks bad but I’m a fan of Anya Taylor-Joy and I’m a sucker for original Sci-Fi.  
  
2/14 Captain America: Brave New World – Guys, I’m worried about this one. Early mumblings about bad test screenings and many reshoots. Plus Anthony Mackie just doesn’t have the charisma of Chris Evans. My only intrigue is Harrison Ford as Red Hulk. Great actor. Cool character. Side note, if you have not watched Harrison Ford in Shrinking, watch that shit right now!  
  
2/21 The Monkey – At first I thought this was another haunted creepy doll generic movie. Then I saw the trailer and it made me think this is something maybe a little more original than that. Oz Perkins is the director and for as much flak as Longlegs got the atmosphere was top notch. 
   
2/14 Black Bag – Another Steven Soderbergh film. The trailer didn’t do much for me but Michael Fassbender is great. And apparently type cast as a hit man from now on.  
  
# MARCH  
3/7 Mickey 17. Bong Joon-Ho has a great catalog of films. Robert Pattinson has shown the past few years he is insanely more talented then just being pretty boy Edward Cullen. Plus original Sc-FI. MAKE MORE ORIGINAL MOVIES. My most anticipated movie of March.  
  
3/14 The Electric State – Another Netflix bomb I’m thinking. Glad it’s an original story though. I miss the days when Chris Pratt was an up and coming talent and not the same guy in every movie.  
  
3/21 Ash – This is directed by the psychedelic/rap/electronic artist Flying Lotus. If you haven’t heard his music it’s kind of like flipping on Adult Swim at 3 in the morning. I also am always curious why Aaron Paul never blew up post-Breaking Bad.  
  
# APRIL  
4/4 A Minecraft Movie – Ass. Jack Black what is you doin? Get that bag I guess.  
  
4/11 Drop – “A widowed mother's first date in years takes a terrifying turn when she's bombarded with anonymous threatening messages on her phone during their upscale dinner, leaving her questioning if her charming date is behind the harassment.” Sounds like a creative concept for a fun horror movie.  
  
4/18 Sinners – Trailer was vague as hell. Ryan Coogler and Michael B. Jordan doing a (supernatural?) horror movie. Sign me up.  
  
4/18 The Ritual – Another exorcism movie but I will watch anything with Dan Stevens in it.  
  
4/25 Until Dawn – Fan of the game. Curious how they do this as the game was basically a movie in itself. I heard the story will have no ties to the game. Then what’s the point of using the name? Actually just thought of this as I am typing, but would be really cool if they did a Black Mirror: Bandersnatch type movie where you make choices for the characters and that affects what kind of ending of the movie you get just like the game. That would be cool.  
  
4/25 The Accountant 2 – It’s been so long since the first one. I remember enjoying it but can’t remember exactly what it was about. Ben Affleck is a bad ass with Aspergers? Autism? I can’t remember.  
  
# MAY  
5/2 Thunderbolts – Florence Pugh = Great. David Harbor as Red Guardian = entertaining. Wyatt Russell = severely underrated and US Agent is a cool character. Plus Sentry is an interesting villain. I just have so many trust issues with Marvel nowadays. Plus the fact that James Gunn made an excellent Suicide Squad already takes the steam out of my sails for this one.  
  
5/16 Final Destination – DJ Khaled Voice “anotha one.”  
  
5/16 Hurry Up Tomorrow – The Weeknd has a movie with Jenna Ortega coming out? Huh. The more you know.  
  
5/23 Mission Impossible: Final R	eckoning – These movies are always in a class of their own. The last one ended on a cliff hanger as well.  
  
5/23 Lilo &amp; Stitch – Can we all collectively boycott Disney cartoons remade into live action films? Love the original and at least they got the look of Stitch right.  
  
5/30 – Life of Chuck – My most anticipated movie of the YEAR. Mike Flanagan is an artist and now he is doing something other than horror. Stacked cast. I’m ready to contemplate the meaning of life.  
  
# JUNE  
6/9 From the World of John Wick: Ballerina – Ana De Armas is my celebrity crush but I’ve heard bad things about this movie.  
  
6/13 Elio – Only including because Pixar. Does not look great to me.  
  
6/13 How to Train Your Dragon – Who asked for this?  
  
6/20 28 Years Later – Wasn’t the biggest fan of the originals but maybe they deserve a rewatch. Alex Garland is a talented writer. The trailer was also nerve wracking without giving anything away.  
  
6/27 F1 – Brad Pitt is the GOAT. The amount of money they spent on this film and the fact they filmed sequences with actually F1 drivers is pretty cool. Also the same director who directed Top Gun: Maverick which was insanely filmed. My most anticipated of June.  
  
6/27 Megan 2 – The first one was a nice surprise. Don’t think they needed to do a sequel though.  
  
# JULY  
7/2 Jurassic World: Rebirth – Okay hear me out. Jurassic Park is my favorite movie of all time. I know all the Jurassic World movies have been ass. If there is anyone who can pull it off it’s Gareth Edwards. The way he films locations and environments just make everything feel epic. (Creator, Rouge One, Godzilla). I think it’s written by the original screenwriter of Jurassic Park. I also have a hard time believing Scarlett Johansson &amp; Mahershala Ali would sign up for this if it wasn’t quality.  
  
7/4 Untitled Trey Parker film – The guy behind South Park is making a movie with Kendrick Lamar in the lead. Read that again.  
  
7/11 Superman – As a marvel fan, outside of Batman, I have never been thrilled by DC. I have always thought Superman’s aesthetic was kind of lame. James Gunn just has a way with these comic book characters. The trailer looks colorful like Guardians was. And did you see the puppy in the trailer? Just adorable.  
  
7/25 Fantastic Four: First Steps – The casting has been excellent. Pedro Pascal is great. Joseph Quinn stole the show in Stranger Things. Ebon Moss-Bachrach was great in The Bear. No way Marvel can fuck this up right?  
  
# AUGUST  
8/1 Naked Gun – There’s not any good quality spoof movies anymore. Directed by Akiva Schaffer, one of the members of The Lonely Island. Based on a story written by Family Guy’s Seth MacFarlane. Liam Nesson replaces Leslie Nielsen. There’s gotta be a joke somewhere in there about how similar their names are. That’s the thing right?  
  
8/8 The Battle of Bakatan Cross – Paul Thomas Anderson directing Leonardo Dicaprio and Benecio Del Toro. Need I say more?  
  
8/8 Vicious – The premise sounds intriguing. “Dakota Fanning spends the night fighting for her existence as she slips down a rabbit hole contained inside a gift from a late-night visitor.” I’m a sucker for Quasi-Horror thriller mindfuck movies.  
  
8/15 Nobody 2 – The first one was great. Wish Bob Odenkirk was in more stuff.  
  
8/29 Insidious Sequel – Why release this right before the Conjuring movie comes out?  
  
# SEPTEMBER  
9/5 Conjuring: Last Rites – I haven’t really kept up with these movies since the first few.  
  
 9/19 Him – Whatever happened to the Jordan Peele film that was supposed to be released around this time but got delayed? I thought it was this but I see he is only the producer.  
  
9/26 The Bride – The second Frankenstein movie we will be getting this year. Christian Bale can do no wrong so.  
  
# OCTOBER  
10/3 Roofman – Just google the plot to this movie. Seriously.  
  
10/10 Tron: Ares – Have never seen the original nor the remake. I know it will be a visual spectacle. Don’t know if I can support Jared Leto though.  
  
10/17 Black Phone 2 – First one was decent. I don’t know if it needed a sequel though.  
  
10/17 Good Fortune – A comedy film written, directed, and starring Aziz Ansari. I always liked him even before he got cancelled. Keanu Reeves is a Guardian Angel who swaps lives with lowlife Aziz and his wealthy boss Seth Rogen. We need more comedy films.  
  
10/24 Mortal Kombat 2 – Okay I know the first one wasn’t good. But we got Karl Urban as Johnny Cage. Maybe the movie based on people fighting to the death in a tournament will actually have people fighting to the death in a tournament this time.  
  
# NOVEMBER  
11/7 Predator: Bad Lands – Prey was great. The Predator is a protagonist in this one? That’s all I know. 
   
11/7 Bugonia – I just don’t get Yorgos Lanthimos’ movies. Jesse Plemons is a national treasure though.  
  
11/14 Now You See Me 3 – Never thought these movies were that good. Are people excited about this?  
  
11/21 Running Man – Glenn Powell had a huge 2024. Never saw the original but Edgar Wright is so talented that I am excited for this one.  
  
11/21 Wicked 2 – Just watched the first one tonight. I enjoyed the emotional moments and the humor even though I don’t like musicals. It kind of reminded me of a less goth Harry Potter for theater kids.  
  
11/26 Zootopia 2 – The first one was surprisingly great.  
  
# DECEMBER  
12/5 Five Nights at Freddys 2 – Never saw the first one. Thought it looked bad.  
  
12/19 Avatar 3 – Wasn’t a huge fan of the first one. A sort of by numbers story. Found myself enjoying the second one. These movies are visually groundbreaking though.  
  
12/19 The Sponge Bob Movie – Sponge Bob has really went down hill since Steven Hillenburg died.  
  
12/25 Anaconda – Paul Rudd &amp; Jack Black are remaking Anaconda. What? One of my favorite sub-genres is horror comedies so I am the target demographic for whatever this movie is.  
  
12/25 Marty Supreme – Josh Safdie is directing Timothee Chalamet as a ping pong prodigy. Plus Tyler the Creator makes his acting debut.
  
# Too Be Determined  
TBD Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Story – The cast is always stacked. Benoit Blanc is such a good character.  
  
TBD Scary Movie 6 – It’s been a while old friend. So many new horror tropes to spoof off of. The Wayan’s brothers are reuniting for this as well.  
  
TBD Death of a Unicorn – The premise is absolutely bonkers. Paul Rudd is great. Will Poulter is also severely underrated and it looks like he steals the show in this one.  
  
TBD Happy Gilmore 2 – My favorite Adam Sandler movie. This is going to suck though isn’t it?  
  
TBD Warfare – Alex Garland is back with another war movie. This time he co-directed it with a former Navy Seal for a realistic depiction of the Iraq war. I’m expecting a very tense Black Hawk Down kind of action flick. Something a little different than Civil War was.  
  
TBD Frankenstein – Guillermo Del Toro will direct with Oscar Issac as the mad scientist and Jacob Elordi as the monster. Del Toro creates beautiful stories with all sorts of strange creatures so I don’t expect this one to be any different."	/r/movies/comments/1hsnebr/my_thoughts_on_the_many_upcoming_2025_movie/	https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hsnebr/my_thoughts_on_the_many_upcoming_2025_movie/
mi7	movies	1heu25h	1734274132	I really hope we don't get more movies made in the filming style of MI: Dead Reckoning. Personal opinions.	"Don't get me wrong...I'm OK with the storyline enough that I'm not going to discuss / spoiler it here. It's the filmmaking/cinematography I can't take. 

Especially (though not exclusively) in the HDR format, it's like a combination of the ""soap opera"" smoothing mode on some TVs, combined with a shooting style that's like watching video game cutscenes. The HDR and de-aging tricks they're playing make it feel even more artificial. Just watched it again recently and it keeps making me go through the settings on my home theater rig looking for missing audio tracks, ""smoothign"", etc but no...it's the movie.  :("	/r/movies/comments/1heu25h/i_really_hope_we_dont_get_more_movies_made_in_the/	https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1heu25h/i_really_hope_we_dont_get_more_movies_made_in_the/

"So, early in the movie, Ethan is trying to find a lead on a mysterious arms dealer known only by the name ""Max"". There's a montage of him searching the internet for information, and as ridiculous as it is, at one point he actually types in ""www.max.com"" to see if that leads to anything (gotta love 90s movie internet scenes). Obviously, back when the movie came out, there was no such thing as streaming services like HBO Max, but now there are, and Paramount Plus hosts all the MI movies, and I just find it kind of funny that they accidentally ended up in a situation where one of the most iconic movies on their platform contains what's essentially a product placement for their competition. Plus, does that mean HBO had to actually buy the ""max.com"" domain from Paramount? Because I was under the impression that if a movie contained a made-up URL, the producers of the movie had to actually buy that domain (usually it'll just redirect to a website advertising the movie). Although maybe the movie was old enough that Paramount no longer needed to own it, and HBO just snatched it up. Anyway, I'm probably the only person on earth who cares about this at all lol but I just found it amusing."	/r/movies/comments/1gu7nc9/i_find_it_amusing_that_the_original_mission/	https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1gu7nc9/i_find_it_amusing_that_the_original_mission/

But Tom Cruise is just so good that he turned the movies past GP in blockbuster hits. ""The Final Reckoning"" seems to be the swan song. Do you think they should continue? If so, how? Personally I think the MI franchise is synonymous with Cruise so I don't know who could possibily fill those shoes nor do I know any actor who would even dare, given the crazy stunts that come with the terrirory. But they could go the James Bond route, do a full reboot and recast Ethan Hunt. With the right writing team and the perfect lead who has charisma in spades they could turn Ethan Hunt into the american James Bond. The elements are all there. Crazy gadgety spy world, stunts that make you sweat and keep you on the edge of your seat, awesome fight scenes (who can forget Cavill reloading his arms), Ethan's girls. Yeah I'm team reboot."	/r/movies/comments/1gptnzw/should_they_retire_the_mission_impossible/	https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1gptnzw/should_they_retire_the_mission_impossible/

mi7	TrueFilm	156zd3e	1690070254	My Elvis review	"Elvis
 
Did you grow up with Elvis Presley? If so, you have probably already seen Elvis, which came out in 2022. Elvis is a musical drama about his rise to fame and how he died. Baz Luhrmann is the director. It stars Austin Butler, Tom Hanks from the Toy Story franchise, Olivia DeJonge, Dacre Montgomery from Stranger Things, Luke Bracey, and Richard Roxburgh from Mission Impossible 2.
 
In June 2022, a biopic about Elvis Presley’s life came out. Presley’s dancing on stage, his singing, and love of writing music is portrayed well by Austin Butler. Butler’s movements, singing, and persona captures who Presley was before taking drugs. Tom Hanks played his manager, Colonel Tom Parker, who signed him to a record label. They had a complicated relationship, but ultimately Parker didn’t have Presley’s best interest in mind.
 
Not everything in this film was accurate. The biggest difference between the movie and reality, was the age Priscilla was when Presley met her. Elvis would make you believe they were around the same age, where in fact she was only 14 and he was 24 when they met. They got married when she was only 21, which still seems very young to make a commitment like that.
 
Unfortunately, all the sad parts about the doctors feeding him drugs and Parker cheating him out of money is all true. If only Presley had a different manager things might have turned out very differently.
 
His style of music combines numerus genres and backgrounds. The combination of gospel, country, and blues would help bring segregated groups together. Along with his personality and movements on stage, he would become known as the king of rock and roll, as well as inspire future musicians."	/r/TrueFilm/comments/156zd3e/my_elvis_review/	https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/156zd3e/my_elvis_review/

In my opinion, I think Zemeckis, Howard, Columbus are the only directors on this list who'd have a hard time getting a $100m budget for their next films.

But does the answer change if we're talking about getting a $100m budget for an original non-IP movie? I think it does. I think in that case, Zemeckis, Howard, Columbus, Yates, Raimi, and Watts would all struggle.

And I feel like Burton and Bay are right on the cusp."	/r/movies/comments/1oz8360/which_topgrossing_directors_will_have_a_hard_time/	https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1oz8360/which_topgrossing_directors_will_have_a_hard_time/
oppenheimer	TrueFilm	1ova43a	1762965579	Which film directors has had the most amount of feature films with 3 hours or more runtime?	"3 hours + runtime in a movie fascinates me on some level. I believe it is mainly because it is a privilege that is only granted to film directors that have proven themselves to be successful and have a distinct voice (like PTA with Magnolia, Nolan with Oppenheimer, Spielberg with Schindler's List) or to movie franchises that are very successful (like Avatar 2 and 3, Avengers Endgame, Lord of the Rings trilogy)


Avatar 3 was recently announced to have a running time of 3 hours and 15 minutes making it the third James Cameron movie to reach the 3 hours runtime after Titantic and Avatar 2.

Martin Scorscese has 4 movies that reach the 3 hour runtime with Casino, Wolf of Wall Street, The Irishman and Killers of the Flower Moon.

Thank you so much for all of your questions!

I really loved answering them - and plenty definitely made me really have to think (although I hope you don't hold me to my Oscar/Bafta predictions - we're still four-plus months away with a lot of films to see!) I stayed a bit later to make sure I got to everyone, I think!

This has also helped me really get in the mood for the London Film Festival and the whirlwind of the next two weeks. If you're attending and see me, please say hi! I always love a good chat about what you've just seen and what you thought about it. And after LFF, we'll be onto a crazy November for releases (Wicked: For Good, The Running Man, loads of LFF films like Anemone)!

If you want to keep up with my reviews, opinions and features, do please stay in touch via socials - I do try and do video reviews too for [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@tori_brazier), so there'll be plenty coming there from LFF.

It's been a pleasure chatting with you all and nerding out over films! I won't do a Tom Cruise and say 'see you at the movies!' because I'm not balancing on the wing of a plane - but know that I thought about it (the catchphrase, not the flying bit!)

As someone who's been writing about cinema for over a decade, I've attended film festivals all over Europe, including Cannes, Venice, Mediterrane (Malta) and Sands (St Andrews), as well as the London Film Festival multiple times - that one in particular goes back many years, after cutting my teeth as a student critic there.

I've also been fortunate enough in my work to interview some of the biggest names in film, from [Christopher Nolan](https://metro.co.uk/2023/11/22/christopher-nolan-thinks-one-issue-may-affect-oppenheimers-oscars-19847120/) and [Meg Ryan](https://metro.co.uk/2023/12/14/meg-ryans-new-rom-com-left-sleepless-first-time-19968132/) to [Dame Judi Dench](https://metro.co.uk/2023/03/15/judi-dench-thinks-david-bradley-forgot-first-time-working-together-18443802/), [Denzel Washington](https://metro.co.uk/2022/01/17/denzel-washington-last-to-know-about-son-john-davids-acting-career-15928808/), [Diane Keaton](https://metro.co.uk/2023/05/09/diane-keaton-denies-screen-icon-status-but-loves-co-star-andy-garcia-18748063/) – and even the Muppets!

After [Venice](https://metro.co.uk/2025/09/05/best-worst-weirdest-movies-2025-venice-film-festival-24075204/) wrapped up last month, I plunged straight into gearing up for my fifth festival of the year on home turf at the BFI London Film Festival, where titles like [Guillermo del Toro’s Frankenstein,](https://metro.co.uk/2025/08/30/frankensteins-oscar-isaac-jacob-elordi-power-epic-film-netflix-will-ever-24036305/) Luca Guadagnino’s [After the Hunt](https://metro.co.uk/2025/08/29/hunt-julia-roberts-juiciest-role-ages-disappointed-24030936/) with Julia Roberts, and Daniel Day-Lewis’s return in Anemone are all set to make waves.

oppenheimer	movies	1nlq7fx	1758347424	'Oppenheimer' (2023) leaves you in awe.	"Watched the film for the 3rd time recently and it continues to amaze with how much it accomplishes. You don't fully grasp the film on the first watch. It is incredible how much story Nolan packs in the 3 hour runtime.

It's a film about Oppenheimer the scientist, the man, the political figure, but it's also about the Manhatten project, it's about Strauss vs Oppenheimer, it's about determination of scientists to keep on pushing boundaries (which is not always for the best), it's about how the machinery builds heroes only to spit them out when their usefulness is over, among other things.

And all this is shown by employing a majestic score, impeccable acting, inspired editing which reminds you of the great editing work done in JFK (1991) and great cinematography. It's a film where 90% of it is about a few people talking in small rooms but the film always feel epic in scope.

Now the film has faults and is not perfect. The problem of music overpowering dialogue still is a feature of a Nolan film here and has not justification. Similarly, Nolan should have explained some aspects a bit better because some character names or events come up here of which the audience is expected to be on the know but isn't always the case. When a film requires a bit of outside research to grasp the film fully, that is not the ideal scenario.

Nolan has made many good films and a couple of questionable films too but I think Oppenheimer might just be his best which shows he is just getting better and better. It's a film that I see enduring for long."	/r/movies/comments/1nlq7fx/oppenheimer_2023_leaves_you_in_awe/	https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1nlq7fx/oppenheimer_2023_leaves_you_in_awe/
oppenheimer	movies	1n7k1cp	1756917989	What is the most overhyped film of all time?	"I’ve been thinking about this for a while. Every couple of years, there’s a movie that everyone talks about like it’s the second coming of cinema. Critics can’t stop praising it, people online call it a masterpiece, friends tell you you HAVE to see it. Then you finally sit down and watch it and… it just doesn’t hit the same. Not bad, just nowhere near what it was hyped up to be.

For me, that was Oppenheimer. The whole “see it in IMAX 70mm” marketing got me to buy the pricey tickets, and I was expecting some massive, overwhelming spectacle. Instead it felt like I paid extra to sit through a really long courtroom drama. Performances were good, a few scenes stood out, but honestly it was kind of a slog and not the “life changing” event people made it sound like.

So I’m curious, what’s that movie for you? The one everyone else seems to worship, but you walked out thinking, “that’s it?”"	/r/movies/comments/1n7k1cp/what_is_the_most_overhyped_film_of_all_time/	https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1n7k1cp/what_is_the_most_overhyped_film_of_all_time/
oppenheimer	TrueFilm	1lue9yz	1751944848	Are Critics Biased Against Modern Film?	"Recency bias is a phenomenon when audiences favor the most recent films, literature, etc. to the exclusion of older ones. However, while this is certainly the case (especially among contemporary audiences it seems sometimes), it also feels like critics and those analyzing art are simply averse to modern films even if they are arguably on the same level creatively as older films. For example...

We have no problem accepting movies like Bridge on the River Kwai and Lawrence of Arabia as classic epics. But when newer films that shoot for the title of epic come out, films like Oppenheimer and There Will be Blood (I am not implying that these are better than the older films I named, or even as good), they are criticized as pretend epics and pretentious... films reaching for greatness. It's almost a losing scenario: if you try to make a film of the same quality, you will be pegged as pretentious, hacky, and gimmicky. This is somewhat discouraging for people who want to have a future in the industry. It's difficult to make a great film if actively trying to do so gets you blasted by people like Armond White and numerous other critics. 

Is it possible that recency bias among audiences is being done in reverse by critics, and if not, I genuinely would like to know what I'm missing?"	/r/TrueFilm/comments/1lue9yz/are_critics_biased_against_modern_film/	https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/1lue9yz/are_critics_biased_against_modern_film/
oppenheimer	movies	1ln4d7v	1751165795	Whats the movie that makes you say “they dont make em like they used to”	Easily has to be Gladiator. Great cast and scenery. Good enough length to be long but not too long. Joaquin is a perfect villian and Russell Crowe is in great shape as a perfect protagonist. Kind of a breakout role for the African guy from Blood Diamond. But all in all I havent seen a movie that makes me feel like Gladiator does in recent years.

oppenheimer	movies	1llpz0b	1751018228	What’s the BEST Christopher Nolan movie I should watch next?	"Just watched one of Nolan’s films and man… I finally get why people call him a genius
His movies don’t feel like movies
They feel like a full-blown experience
The way he messes with time and reality had my brain doing gymnastics

It’s not just about big moments or crazy visuals
It’s how he slowly pulls you in and then hits you with something that makes you go wait what
And then it all starts making sense
It’s weird but kinda beautiful too

Now I’m hooked
Like I seriously wanna watch more of his stuff
But I haven’t seen all his movies yet
I know there’s Inception Interstellar Tenet Memento The Prestige Oppenheimer Dunkirk
But I’m not sure which one to go for next

So if you’ve seen them
Tell me which one hit you the hardest
Like the one that really stuck in your head for days
Or the one that had you sitting in silence after it ended thinking about life and time and everything in between

Don’t give spoilers
Just drop the name
I wanna go in fresh like I did with this one

Nolan’s got this way of making your brain work while also making you feel stuff
And I’m here for it

So yeah
Which Nolan film is your personal favorite
The one that made you go
Damn this guy’s different

Let me know
I need another mind-bender to dive into soon"	/r/movies/comments/1llpz0b/whats_the_best_christopher_nolan_movie_i_should/	https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1llpz0b/whats_the_best_christopher_nolan_movie_i_should/

oppenheimer	movies	1l6zb47	1749456996	Oppenheimer should have used the trinity test footage	Exactly as the title suggests. Oppenheimer shouldn't have used that janky, 30ft tall gasoline explosion. It should have used the real footage from the trinity test. It's on youtube. Even if they had to pay the American government money, that's fine. Looking at the trinity footage, i wouldn't have noticed it as out of the ordinary in the film. I see literally NO reasons as to why they didn't.	/r/movies/comments/1l6zb47/oppenheimer_should_have_used_the_trinity_test/	https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1l6zb47/oppenheimer_should_have_used_the_trinity_test/

oppenheimer	movies	1l3g6i7	1749068924	What do you guys think of an interval/intermission in the movie in the Cinema?	"If you guys have ever watched an Indian movies specifically Bollywood you will notice something interesting around the middle which is an interval or intermission. There is like a 10-15 min break in the screening and allows people to get some snack &amp; get a stretch or use the washroom without missing anything in the movie. The intermission comes at an interesting time in the plot but before the next act begins.

I know this really isn't the culture in Hollywood or most international cinema but I think it could be a great idea for longer movies, especially those like Oppenheimer and Mission Impossible which were close to 3 hrs in length. What do you guys think about this?"	/r/movies/comments/1l3g6i7/what_do_you_guys_think_of_an_intervalintermission/	https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1l3g6i7/what_do_you_guys_think_of_an_intervalintermission/

oppenheimer	movies	1k8iqzs	1745689625	Oppenheimer - Rewatch and Thoughts	"Oppenheimer Discussion

I want to start off by stating that I know I’m posting this very late, the movie is almost two years old, but I love it and wanted to share my thoughts and opinions on it.  Nothing stated here is going to be a new revelation or a new discussion point that hasn’t been brought up already, but I want to know your thoughts on my thoughts.  You may disagree with some of my views, but that’s also why I wanted to share this, to hear your opinions on it all.

- Fission and Fusion, Oppenheimer and Strauss, Alienation, Flip-Flopping, and Martyrdom -

Oppenheimer and Strauss are introduced right after one another, as two sides of the same bomb.  They are both prideful men who, went slighted, will respond in different but similar explosive ways.  

Oppenheimer, when made a fool of in front of his fellow peers by his instructor, Patrick Blackett, chooses to inject the instructor’s apple full of cyanide as revenge.  This response by Oppenheimer shows that he is impulsive enough to attempt murder when his ego is damaged in front of his peers.  In my opinion it also shows that he does not “think before he speaks”, that he does not think about the consequences of his actions in a sensible manner.  The next morning he goes to stop the apple from being eaten by his instructor, Patrick Blackett, but Neils Bohr, who was not his intended target, almost eats it.  

Oppenheimer created an object of death, then regrets it when it is almost too late, and almost kills someone who was not its intended target. 
This happens to him as a relatively young student, and throughout the movie he personally passes this act of humiliation on to his peers on multiple occasions.  This comes to bite him in the ass, like a snake in your toilet.

Oppenheimer has no filter in his thoughts and actions throughout the film. All of this adds up and ultimately causes him to lose his security clearance and the privileges that come with it.

On multiple occasions Oppenheimer humiliates his peers, whether it be intentional or unintentional, and this causes a chain reaction throughout his life that causes his own destruction.  The people who hurt Oppenheimer’s security clearance case is someone who Oppenheimer has humiliated.  First and foremost is Strauss, obviously.  
Strauss is someone who wanted to be respected amongst his peers, but had an inferiority complex that is apparent throughout the film.  This inferiority complex caused even the slightest remarks to be perceived as personal attacks to his ego and place amongst his peers.  I’m not saying that there were not blatant slights made towards Strauss, for example when Oppenheimer makes a fool of Strauss in front of their peers during the shipping of isotope discussion.  However, there are relatively little things that added up over time that Strauss held internally until it was let loose in an explosive manner (concocting the security clearance case against Oppenheimer).  Throughout the film these perceived slights included:

A. Insisting to be called Admiral Strauss when called Mr. Strauss by his Senate aide.
B. Responding to being called once lowly shoe salesman by Oppenheimer, and then correcting him saying, “no, just a shoe salesman”.
C. At the AEC gathering discussing the spy and filter paper detecting a Russian atomic weapon, Strauss tries to give his thoughts to Oppenheimer on what the committee should do regarding this, but Oppenheimer disregards him and doesn’t even look at him when saying that Strauss is not on the advisory committee and that he essentially has no say on the outcome.
D. At Strauss’s birthday celebration, when Strauss approaches Oppenheimer at the bar with his son and fiancée, Oppenheimer doesn’t even give them the time of day and essentially ignores them.
E. The whole Oppenheimer and Einstein misunderstanding.  Strauss thought Oppenheimer soured Einstein on Strauss, when in actuality something more important was going through their minds.  In actuality in was nothing personal towards Strauss.

Now I am not saying that Strauss is entirely wrong in all of his perceptions of these actions and events.  Strauss has a right to be called Admiral, being called a lowly is hurtful, not getting looked in the eye by your peer and straight-up dismissed of your opinion in hurtful, having your son and his fiancée essentially ignored on your huge birthday celebration is wrong, and having one of, if not the the most respected scientist in the world, Einstein, not evening look or respond to you must sting terribly when you hold that person in the highest regard.

What I am saying is that these things were blown out of proportion by Strauss, and some of these slights had nothing to do with Strauss at all.  At Strauss’s birthday celebration, he thinks Oppenheimer is indifferent towards his son and fiancée because he is pre-occupied on the fact that it was revealed that there was a spy at Los Alamos, and that Oppenheimer was pissed at being wrong about that and pissed that Strauss was right about that, but in actuality Oppenheimer was pissed about the H-bomb program going forward.  Oppenheimer still should have congratulated the engaged couple, it would have been the easy and right thing to do, especially if it was Strauss’s son and on Strauss’s birthday event, but Oppenheimer decided to be rude.
The Oppenheimer and Einstein discussion where Strauss felt that Oppenheimer soured Einstein on Strauss had nothing to do with Strauss at all, they just got done talking about how they might have cause a chain reaction that destroys the world, their minds were preoccupied on that.  Einstein had nothing against Strauss obviously, but Strauss didn’t see it that way.  Any slight was internalized, overthought, and held tightly together and let out in an unhealthy way.

Lastly, Oppenheimer alienated his peers throughout the film, has conflicting thoughts and actions, and plays a martyr throughout.

Alienations:

1. Oppenheimer on multiple occasions alienates himself from Strauss, mentioned above.
2. Oppenheimer alienates himself from Edward Teller.  This is done by making Teller feel foolish when Teller brought up the creation of a fusion bomb, but also on the multiple occasions where Teller wants to know Oppenheimer’s thoughts on the bomb, but was never given a straight answer.
3. Oppenheimer cheats on his wife with Jean Tatlock, but also with Ruth Tolman.  Ruth was Richard Tolman’s wife, and Strauss tells Ernest Lawrence (Richard’s friend) that Oppenheimer was having an affair with Richard’s wife which led to the death of Richard.  This is one of the reasons why Lawrence was going to speak against Oppenheimer.  Lawrence also sees the how Oppenheimer disrespects his peers at the AEC filter paper meeting, and even attempts to call him out on it.

Flip-Flopping and Playing the Martyr

1. Oppenheimer attempts to kill his instructor, but says he didn’t hate him and that he liked him very much to Jean Tatlock.
2. He insists at Los Alamos to call what they’re building a “gadget”, but when it’s announced that the atom has been split, he immediately makes the bomb connection.  Oppenheimer knows what he is building, he knows what it will do, and he tries to convince himself that the bomb’s creation is an inevitability (which personally I agree with).  He knows that the bomb must be built before the Nazi’s build it, he knows it will be used a weapon of mass destruction, but he cannot come to terms with that.  After it’s use he feels like he has blood on his hands because he led the invention of this weapon, but he liked the fame, power, and privileges that leading the creation of the bomb provided.  Neils Bohr states this theme when he tells Oppenheimer that he “cannot lift the stone without being ready for the snake that is revealed”.
3. Oppenheimer is haunted throughout the film by the bomb and what it will do, the power it will bring and the mass destruction it will cause, but the idea of being a bringer of death, a god-like figure, gets him off.
4. As Strauss said, Oppenheimer wanted to be remembered as the leader in creating one of the most important inventions/weapons in history, but not remembered for the lives that his creation took.
5. Oppenheimer wants to have his cake and eat it too.  He wants to cheat on his wife but is distraught and wants to be comforted when his infidelity adds to the death of Jean Tatlock.  Kitty tells him to his face that he can’t commit the sin and then expect people to feel sorry for him.  Kitty also states that Oppenheimer enduring the security clearance ambush is a way for him to feel like a martyr, to accept the punishment for the culmination of his actions.
6. Oppenheimer knows what an atomic bomb will do but he spearheads its creation, and then he feels like he has blood on his hands and wants people to feel sorry for him, he wants people to tell him that there was no choice but to build the bomb, and that he wasn’t responsible for all the deaths, while at the same time enjoying the perks of being responsible for the creation of the bomb.
7. When dropping off his son Peter at Chevalier’s, he says he knows that he is a terrible person and pauses because he wants to hear from Chevalier that he is not a terrible person, and that what he is doing is necessary.  In my opinion Chevalier only accepted taking Oppenheimer’s and Kitty’s son in because Chevalier wanted to stay on Oppenheimer’s good side in order to pass on Los Alamos info to the Russians.

At the end, both Oppenheimer and Strauss share similar fates.  They are both denied what they are after.  Oppenheimer does not get his security clearance approved, and Strauss is denied his cabinet position.
The cause boils down to each man alienating their peers.  Oppenheimer is shown to do this time and time again throughout the film, and Strauss’s avarice towards Oppenheimer is obvious to those in the scientific community who are paying attention to the situation, to those whose minds aren’t clouded by pettiness.

David Hill, played by Rami Malek, has little screen time in the movie, but his role in my opinion is one of the most interesting.  Even though Hill was treated with disrespect by Oppenheimer the first two times we see him in the movie (Oppenheimer knocks his pen down in one scene, then his clipboard down in his next scene), Hill comes to Oppenheimers defense in his third scene.  Hill states that Strauss has a vendetta against Oppenheimer.  Hill is able to see the bigger picture and not focus on these relatively small slights, and Hill doesn’t try to get revenge on Oppenheimer even though his only interactions with him were ones of disrespect.

I think Hill is the level headed character to which Oppenheimer and Strauss should be compared.  He is doing what is best for the scientific community without letting personal feelings get in the way of doing what is right.

TL:DR - This was mainly a summary with some opinions included.  I wanted to highlight how the film shows the nuances and actions that added up, over a long period of time, and led to major defeats in the lives of Oppenheimer and Strauss.  I understand this included a lot of obvious re-telling of what occurred in the movie, but I wanted to put it together in summary form.  Oppenheimer and Strauss’s desire to feel important and respected, and their paths to achieve this, are similar in a tragic way.  I believe this movie deserved all the praise and rewards it achieved, and I think Christopher Nolan did a great job telling this story in three hours."	/r/movies/comments/1k8iqzs/oppenheimer_rewatch_and_thoughts/	https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1k8iqzs/oppenheimer_rewatch_and_thoughts/

oppenheimer	movies	1jtgc67	1744014302	The State of Cinema	"I saw something recently that I felt like I just had to talk about. As some of you might already know, on the 27th of March, Marvel did a 5 hour stream to reveal PART of the cast for the next Avengers movie Avengers Doomsday. Like many, after seeing the cast list I was initially also very excited, I grew up watching the Xmen movies from the 2000s so it's obvious to see why Sir Patrick Stewert and Sir Ian Mckellen alone would be enough to get me excited for this movie, but for us to also get James Marsden Cyclops, Rebecca Romijn Mystique, and Alan cumming NightCrawler as well just to name a few, is insane. 



The cast list is already ridiculous and without even knowing the rest of the cast, its safe to say that Avengers Doomsday will easily become one of the most expensive movies ever. With a star studded cast like that, its enough to get even non-marvel-fans at the very least intrigued by the movie. Though initially excited, the more I thought about it, the more it made me concerned about the future of Hollywood. 



Ever since Marel found their success with their big avenger cross over movies and the MCU as a whole, people have been trying to recreate their formula of success. Almost every movie nowadays has a budget of 200+ million, where just having 1 big name actor/actress is no longer enough to sell seats. We are spoilt with the likes of the Marvel movies, the DCU movies, and even movies like oppenheimer. 



Now I’m aware that big cast movies isn’t something new, we’ve been having this type of movies, like The Hangover, The Expendables, or even as far back as movies like Ocean’s 11, Italian Job, Jurassic Park. But where back then it would be a treat to get a movie like that once in a while, I feel like these days thats what people expect but not what people want. 



Megalopolis was a movie that came out in 2024, directed by Francis Ford Coppola, it sees Julius Caesar and Franklyn Cicero clash in an alternate 21st Centry New York version of New Rome. The movie's cast had Adam Driver as Julius Caesar and Giancarlo Esposito as Cicero, as well as Aubrey Plaza. Nathalie Emmanuel, Shaia Labeouf, Jon Voight, Jason Schwartzman, Dustin Hoofman and Laurence Fishburne just to name a few. The point is this movie had a lot of talent, when I heard about the movie I was genuinely excited. However, the movie was a box office flop, grossing only 14.3 million worldwide against their budget of 120 million. Similarly, Anora, an indie film that walked out of the oscars with 5 academy awards cost only 6 million to make and grossed a staggering 65 million with no real A list actor/actress headlining their movie. 



Films like Anora shows that people don’t really care about the cast or who is in it, it certainly helps having big name actors but what really sells seats at the cinema is a quality original screenplay. I’m sick of movies now a days all end up feeling like the same movie because studios just keeps hiring the same people and pumping out formulaic movies with similar stories. At the recent cinema con, 21 movies were reveal to be released in 2026, out of the 21, only 3, as far as I know, were original IPs, all the rest were either cash grab sequels of previous franchises like shrek 5, moana 3, ice age 6, or toy story 5, existing ips that are now getting made into movies like street fighter, and masters of the universe, or big IP cinematic universe movies like Avengers doomsday, clay face from DC or Fast x.



Now I’m certainly not hating on any of these movies, as a matter of fact, I’ll probably watch most of them. But with streaming platforms being so prevalent now, people are already having less and less of a reason to go to the cinemas, at least for me, I recently found myself missing the feeling wanting to go to the cinemas to watch something instead of just waiting for it to be on netflix, or disney plus or whatever. There’s almost no point of going to the cinemas anymore when you know for certain that in a few months you can stream it. 



I understand why studios keep pumping out movies that just sells nostalgia, or movies that makes use of certain IP’s existing fan base, like a new DC or Marvel movie, its easy and for them it’s all about meeting KPIs and making money, I get it. But it just seems like capitalism is ruining the film industry, surprise surprise. I want to see more original movies like The Lighthouse, Tenet, Isle of Dogs, Mickey 17, Conclave etc, even megalopolis which I hated, movies that regardless if it ends up being good or not, at least makes me interested and excited about going to watch it in the cinemas, and not just excited because I want to see characters I like on screen interacting like a marvel movie but genuinely excited to watch a movie because the trailer looks good and I want to see what happens and how it ends."	/r/movies/comments/1jtgc67/the_state_of_cinema/	https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1jtgc67/the_state_of_cinema/
oppenheimer	flicks	1jkdq3e	1743000986	A few of my unpopular(?) film opinions | PART TWO	"Read [PART ONE](https://www.reddit.com/r/flicks/comments/1jjhrt2/a_few_of_my_unpopular_film_opinions/) before reading this.

1. Wiley Wiggins' performance in Dazed &amp; Confused is charming and perfectly in line with an awkward teenager. People are just unnecessarily mean. There are honest-to-god bad performances out there, but this ain't it.
2. 2002's Signs - directed by M. Night Shyamalan - shouldn't / doesn't deserve the hate it gets. It is definitely a solid tense and atmospheric movie that's also rewatchable.
3. 1996's Crash - directed by David Cronenberg - has one of the best cream-of-the-crop casting that's hard to replicate anymore now.
4. Say what you will about 1997's Batman &amp; Robin - directed by Joel Schumacher - but you cannot deny it is a rather visually *pretty* looking superhero film. I personally dig those costumes the most.
5. I genuinely love both Clash of the Titans and its sequel, Wrath of the Titans. They're both excellent pop-corn flicks. I'm still holding out for a third part.
6. Djimon Hounsou would make for a killer Kratos in a live-action God of War film.
7. Jesse Eisenberg was unapologetically awesome in Batman v Superman. I'd say one of his top 5 best performances.
8. Batfleck is the best cinematic Batman / Bruce Wayne ever. End of.
9. 2019's Aladdin - directed by Guy Ritchie - is the only live-action Disney film that I *somewhat* prefer over the animated film.
10. Both Aladdin's and Hercules' animated 90s TV series were superior than their animated films.
11. Despite his short screentime, I believe Jason Clarke gave the best performance in Oppenheimer - after Cillian Murphy of course.
12. 2004's Sky Captain &amp; the World of Tomorrow - directed by Kerry Conran - is a *fantastic* movie and I'm tired of pretending it's not. It's one of those films that takes advantage of its medium to the max.
13. Rob Schneider is objectively the worst actor ever. Instant mood kill whenever he's on-screen."	/r/flicks/comments/1jkdq3e/a_few_of_my_unpopular_film_opinions_part_two/	https://www.reddit.com/r/flicks/comments/1jkdq3e/a_few_of_my_unpopular_film_opinions_part_two/

I have Oppenheimer's work (act of killing, globalization tapes), and After the Curfew (from Scorsese's WCP) on the watchlist. Anything else? 

I'd especially love stuff that reflects the philosophy, aesthetic/ cultural values, lifeways, etc. of the country in the way the films of Ozu, Ray, Tarkovsky, etc. reflects theirs. Not necessarily expecting the same mastery of form / technique.

Memento in particular is one of my favourite films and I consider myself a little bit of a cinephile and love foreign and indie films, but I just didn't get all the fuss about Oppenheimer. I learnt nothing new about what happened. I was expecting something extraordinary cinematically from Trinity with Nolan at the helm, but I just felt very underwhelmed by the whole experience.

oppenheimer	movies	1ib9v4w	1737986825	My Controversial Ranking of Every Movie and Show Season I've Ever Watched, as a 16 year old	"[https://imgur.com/a/dXKXW7e](https://imgur.com/a/dXKXW7e)

I had to make it an Imgur link because they don't allow Image posts

**Clarifications:**

This took a very long time to make, and is mostly just a passion project. I've been working on this tierlist for over 6 months I'm pretty sure, but I'm finally finished. This is it. These are my thoughts on every movie and show season I've watched.

Now, to be clear here, the title is I guess slightly clickbait because I can't possibly rank EVERY movie I've ever watched. There are plenty that I just don't remember or care enough about to include them. I wanted to keep my ranking mostly concise to the point I'm comfortable with the ratings I'm giving each one (and, even then, there are some films here that could be lowered/increased by 1 tier).

Now, addressing the elephant in the room here. Yes, my ratings are insanely controversial, polarizing, hot, whatever.

I don't know if this is going to be enough for yall to understand my thought process, but I'm 16. I'm a teenager, and I don't enjoy slow paced movies, ""slow burns"", dialogue heavy films, most classics, and especially not movies that have too big emotional backlash. Apparently though, people here believe that teenagers would also love movies like Oppenheimer or Dune. But I really think that isn't true. Either way though, I'm also hyperactive so that might or might not explain it.

This is the same reason that this list includes barely any if at all non-fictional dramas, like Pride &amp; Prejudice or Oppenheimer. I don't like those, because I think they're boring, and it's fine if you disagree this is just my opinion.

This also leads me to another topic. This tierlist is NOT based on Writing and Filmmaking. I'm rating movies based on enjoyability and what I thought of them right after I finished watching them. Of course, I also take into account things like Plot, Characters, Antagonists, Acting, Pacing, (Well-Executed) Emotion, etc. Writing actually comes close to last place in that list. I'm not put off by plot holes or ""bad dialogues"" as much as other people are (See Old and Star Wars AOTC), unless it is really just beyond horrendous, but that mostly only happens in movies with low budget/homemade films, which aren't present in this list I don't think, and that's because I haven't watched them, and also don't plan to.

Now, I think this goes without saying but this is only my subjective opinion. Feel free to disagree with it. I still put a lot of time and effort into making this tierlist though (mostly because I also had to rewatch plenty of these and watch recaps of most of them to be able to defend my claims) so I would appreciate engagement.

Also, I know I was kind of harsh with the tiers descriptions, and I'm sorry for that. I know I should've included ""(imo)"" after each one of them, especially the description for the 1/10 tier. It's fine if you like those movies

I will respond with reasoning as to why I gave a certain movie or show season a certain score if you have any questions. You might or might not like my answer, but at least I can defend my takes I guess.

Also, regarding the final tier ""Ultimate Spider-Man"", I grew up with that show and I love it very dearly even though most seem to hate it. I wouldn't really call it nostalgia rating though since I rewatched it in preparation for this and I still love most of it, so I kind of separated it from the tierlist entirely. Whether I think it is or isn't better than everything below it is a question that shall remain unanswered

But, again, it or any other film being higher than some other films doesn't mean it has better writing than them, because they often don't. As mentioned before, writing isn't my primary rating scale here at all. So, yeah, that's it. Enjoy the tierlist lol"	/r/movies/comments/1ib9v4w/my_controversial_ranking_of_every_movie_and_show/	https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1ib9v4w/my_controversial_ranking_of_every_movie_and_show/
oppenheimer	movies	1iaoy1a	1737922359	I wish Nolan would make another movie with Hugh Jackman.	"Nolan's ""Oppenheimer"" and upcoming Odyssey movies are stuffed to the brim with every celebrity you can shake a stick at, but you know who's missing from those lists?

Hugh Jackman!

Jackman was the co-lead in ""The Prestige"" and he was great!

But while he ended up making two more movies with Christian Bale, Jackman hasn't gotten the same love.

Nolan obviously has a couple of actors he likes working with on multiple projects (Bale, Caine, Murphy, Hardy) and he often brings out the best in them, or at least some of the most interesting stuff.

It would be great to see what Nolan and Jackman could do together TWENTY DANG YEARS after their first and only collab.

Jackman is great as an actor in regular drama films, but also has lots of experience in genre movies. Same goes for Nolan as a director.

So what are you waiting for, Chris? Either announce Hugh's gonna play Poseidon, or that your next movie will give him a starring role!"	/r/movies/comments/1iaoy1a/i_wish_nolan_would_make_another_movie_with_hugh/	https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1iaoy1a/i_wish_nolan_would_make_another_movie_with_hugh/
oppenheimer	movies	1iamx9b	1737917875	Oppenheimer interview	I watched Oppenheimer when it first came out and this is more a rant than a review. And it's not a rant that particularly adds to move imo, but there is one specific part of the movie that I have not forgotten and it was honestly such a striking moment to me. Obviously the bombs, the morality, all of that is what completed the movie but a sort of niche part of it that stuck with me the most, was during the interview process when Oppenheimer has to be honest about his affair with Jean in front of Kitty. It's that moment when we see what Kitty sees as she hears that. Seeing her husband naked with Jean on top of him, staring into her eyes. I remember crying in the theater over it. It wasn't an important detail I think but it just reminded me of that feeling of betrayal when a partner cheats on you. the feeling of your stomach dropping, your throat tightening. The humiliation, knowing that the person you love did that with someone else. I felt it was a really powerful moment to have Jean and Kitty lock eyes. It really encapsulated how it feels when you find out and you almost feel taunted by that person. That their existence is symbol of failure and your embarrassment. And even though Kitty and Oppenheimer didn't have the romance of the century, the admittance of going behind her back on record, all of it.

A movie that you think didn't deserve that much praise. For me i think Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer (2023). Pretty good movie but not as good as the hype made it out to be and far inferior compared to other Christopher nolan movies.

oppenheimer	TrueFilm	1hrztwh	1735840714	Looking Back On 2024 (A Cinematic Year in Review)	"As a preface, I will only list here what I watched during the past year, which includes the delayees (is that even a word) from 2023, movies moved to 2024 due to the idiotic distribution structure of my country. These include The Iron Claw, The Holdovers, Poor Things, May December, The Zone of Interest, The Boy and the Heron, Priscilla and the Anatomy of a Fall. Some others I didn’t get around to watch or haven’t heard of before 2024, like Sisu, Kiss The Girls or Mr. Holmes. With that out of the way, let’s get down to it!

34. Rebel Moon: A Child of Fire. No surprise here, but I still think it’s a half-decent movie. I mean, of course, most of the plot is claptrap (despite a couple good in-isolation scenes), the lore is established way too haphazardly for its own good and the cinematography doesn’t provide as much gravitas or atmosphere to the scenes as it thinks it is, but Snyder still manages to squeeze out some nice performances (in particular from Michiel Huisman and the delightfully malicious Ed Skrein as Admiral Atticus Noble). And the score by Junkie XL unironically SLAPS. It’s weighty, ethereal and immersive as fuck, especially everytime chorals and angry artificial howling - Noble’s theme - can be heard on the screen. It is ultimately due to the music that the movie is not a failure.

33. Godzilla X Kong: A New Empire. This one’s merit, on the other hand, lies exclusively in the visual spectacle. Here Holkenborg could not cook up something noteworthy, but the action carried hard. I mean, mostly because the Skar King and Shimo’s battle against G and K wore off pretty quickly. The human characters were uncompelling, the story presented no interesting themes, and the visuals I found pretty below average. It was just mediocre.

32. Rebel Moon: The Scargiver. A slight bump as far as overall cinematic quality is concerned. The cinematography offers something more visually enthralling, and this time Snyder’s time wasting pays off in a way. Holkenborg keeps the score quality intact, as is the case with Skrein’s performance. But the movie is still a haphazardly conceived mess of poorly constructed, bizarrely acting individuals I’ve little to no connection to. So, a miss.

31. Ferrari. I don’t have a whole lot to say about it, other than the faux-Italian accents were a definite miss, and everything aside from the racing scenes and Penelope Cruz’s performance was just uninteresting. But Cruz and the races carried hard, plain and simple. Still, a mediocre movie that fails to examine its protagonist.

30. Mr. Holmes. It was an overall interesting take on an older Holmes, with Ian McKellen turning in a memorable performance as both versions of the character. To me the film did a good job juggling three separate plotlines, all of which had some merit. All in all, a graceful portrayal of an aged hero that lost most things and people he cared about. For some it’ll certainly be more graceful than the fates of Indiana Jones, Han Solo and Luke Skywalker.

29. The Boy and the Heron. Compared to how praised it was… I was disappointed. Maybe it was just me getting to know Miyazaki for the first time for real. But interestingly enough, I found very little interesting content in the movie other than the animation itself and the Grey Heron. I sure felt for Mahito, but I didn’t get to know him a whole lot in a substantial way. Nor any other character, really. They were like silhouettes, just passing through the screen, mere figures pushing Mahito to the next plot point. And his grand-grand-grand uncle? A complete afterthought. I don’t even know why he created that fantastical world, and a minute of WW2 carnage coupled with a few throwaway lines about the world’s “wickedness” a theme make not, sadly. But it’s still a good movie.

28. The Beekeeper. I had a good time, despite a plot light on thematics and character, but loaded with an absurd amount of bee metaphors. Adam, Jason Statham’s character, was reasonably grounded with both ruthlessness for capitalist scammers and care for ordinary citizens. Add some nice visuals, twists and supporting performances and you got a good, if overall run-of-the-mill action flick.

27. Scent of a Woman. Yeah, I like it. Most of it boils down to a fucking tour de force performance by Al Pacino and character work related to his character, but he just makes it work, especially with the “I’ll show you OUT OF ORDER!” scene. I won’t elaborate any further.

26. Insurrectionist 1863. For the first time we venture into Poland to see a historical movie telling the story of Father Stanisław Brzóska’s involvement in the January Uprising of 1863. The priest himself aside, the characters weren’t too compelling, but Brzóska’s journey throughout the movie, especially his role as a priest evolving in the conflict, makes it all worth it. This is a piece of cinema hard carried by the protagonist.

25. Screw Mickiewicz. Once more a Polish film which will (most likely) only hit for you if you’re from the country like myself. But it was a genuinely hilarious and lively flick, with a lot of actual understanding of the teenage Poles’ mentality and some fairly emotional moments. Also, a really nice soundtrack assembled from the works of modern Polish rap and pop artists.

24. The Iron Claw. Another overrated - if nearly actually great - darling of 2023. Like with Miyazaki’s piece, I felt little emotional connection to the Von Erich brothers, the most belonging to David - who died first. The amount of bad shit happening in succession was also too much; it felt like, dare I say, misery porn at times. No interesting cinematography (save for the black ‘n’ white opening) or music either. But the movie did present a compelling story looking at the plot elements themselves, and Fritz Von Erich was a very well-realized character.

23. May December. The first proper great movie of the bunch. Maybe some more time should have been spent on dissecting the relationship between Melton’s Joe and Moore’s Gracie, but since the protagonist is a sensationalist, self-important bitch that doesn’t care about the people she’ll be portraying, that’s what we get. Speaking of which, Natalie Portman made the movie for me, it was like a female Kirk Lazarus performance, absolutely stunning. Technical side of things wise it didn’t wow me, but its examination of the subject matter is absolutely commendable.

22. Sisu. Holy crap, what a great action flick. A bunch of decently despicable Nazis against an endlessly adaptable Finnish vet/hermit. Some nice team work between him and the enslaved women in the end, enthralling action and the pure grit make for a great offering. Again, see it in case you have not!

21. Alien: Romulus. I never hated Covenant (I just thought the ending with le bad guy David winning was stupid, which was understandable given the fact I was 14 back then and didn’t truly recognize the merit of bleaker closures in cinema), so I didn’t expect Romulus to be a “return to form”, but its upholding, which it was. Cailee Spaeny once again smashed the hell out of her role, nailing her more relaxed and tense scenes a like. She is also able to just… appear and act genuinely likeable, she makes for a rootable protagonist, y’know? Another standout is David Jonsson, playing an android like he was Paul Bettany or goddamn Michael Fassbender himself. Ian Holm’s undead appearance is irksome, sure, but they managed to disguise it well enough for me not to detect it until after I delved into the discourse. The horror of the aliens? On point. Atmosphere? Impeccable. Visuals? Breathtaking.

20. Rebel Ridge. This one is a milder offering spectacle and politics wise compared to the ones that come after it in the list, but it’s a worthy watch. The opener alone is a powerful one, and while perhaps not entirely accurate to how these things would go down, it gave me a good idea of the possible ways American cops abuse their authority, especially in regards to black people. And it’s consistently great throughout, especially with its execution of the non-killing protagonist.

19. Kiss The Girls. It’s an older one, but it checks out. I especially appreciate the sheer terror of the Casanova, both pre and post-reveal. Morgan Freeman, Cary Elwes and Ashley Judd all crushed their roles. But this won’t do the movie any justice… If you haven’t seen it for yourself, do it.

18. Furiosa. As far as prequels go, this one’s neat. Important info regarding the Mad Max world is there, coupled with brilliant performances by Anya Taylor-Joy (how the hell did she manage to emulate Charlize this well?! HOW?!) and Chris Hemsworth, who, channeling his inner Thor, puts a MadMaxesque spin on it, adding a layer of post-apocalyptic internal hollowness and insatiable, self-fueling cruelty and hatred, bred by some terrible trauma, not unlike Furiosa’s (or Thor’s, for that matter). I suppose that’s the main merit of the movie, the ways in which they mirror each other. Which makes their final scene together a fucking standout. Also, pay attention to the History Man: George Shevtsov is fantastic in the role, and occasionally he drops Thanos-level banger lines, adding both philosophical ideas and vulnerability to the story.

17. Joker: Folie à Deux. Likely the most controversial take, but I love this movie. It takes the well-known story from 2019, puts it in a new setting and makes the most of it. I was especially stoked once I realized the musical inserts were fantasies, extensions of Arthur and Harley’s desires, fears and wishes. The score provided a nice layer of gloominess to the whole, the cinematography was jaw-dropping, and I can’t help but find the conclusion… fitting. Like many others have said before me: it wasn’t about the Clown Prince of Crime. It was about a marginalized man who inadvertently became a symbol and an outlet for disillusioned citizens to embody their own fear and anger, only to be hated, rejected and forgotten once he declared he shared their fear and anger no longer. A beautiful deconstruction.

16. Scarborn. Another Polish film, but this time it’s a historical action flick. Centered around the Kościuszko Insurrection of 1794 it provides a pretty immersive piece of historical fiction centered around how said Insurrection came to be. Wait through the lengthy build up and the final act will wow you with Tarantino-esque tension and spectacle. Some fantastic cinematography, too!

15. Anora. This hurts me the most, because I believe it’s an impressive offering, but lacks “the sauce”. As great as Mikey Madison was as Anora, as believable as the world and characters around her were, I found insufficient amounts of context to care about her as much as Baker wanted me to. How fucking sad it is that I found TOROS, the main henchman character more interesting and entertaining to watch than her? Didn’t help that Baker couldn’t find the right tone for several scenes, especially the supposedly serious ones overloaded with comedic inserts… But his direction, especially the camera movement was without a doubt a true show of skill, and I cannot find any fault in the cinematography and non-lead performances either.

14. Wrooklyn Zoo. Yet another Polish movie in the mix, and most likely the most special one. It’s about Poland’s modern problems, the virtues and sins of the old and the youth and the absolutely amazing yet painful feeling that is love. While I don’t think our protagonists were amazing characters and the final act relies on a bit of resurrectionist Hollywood bullshit, the movie drips with style, heart and distinct energy that’s hard to put into words. Also, the pacing was fantastic. Made it seem like a movie of twice its length yet endlessly captivating.

13. Civil War. My introduction to Alex Garland, and what an introduction that was! My most favorite thing about it is just how hard it drills into the conflict between journalistic integrity and the pervasive sensationalist nature of the job, especially in America. Every single main character felt like a real person with their own ideas and priorities, everyone embodied their characters to a fault, and I could only watch with wonder and horror as their lives and jobs turned to shit due to the eponymous conflict. The final third is as captivating as it is devastating and can really make you think about the possibility of objective, well-intentioned documentation of tragedies.

12. The Holdovers. Maybe the most wholesome and hilarious thing I saw in 2024. Along the incredible, sharp performances by Paul Giamatti, Dominic Sessa and Da’Vine Joy Randolph wraps Alexander Payne’s whimsical yet touching screenplay. It’s a movie that understands the bitter, but at the same time shows them their current state of being doesn’t have to be what defines their life or gives it purpose.

11. Carry-On. I expected it to be a somewhat interesting execution of a promising premise. But man oh MAN, I was not prepared to witness the absolute CINEMA of it all, not at all! Everyone from Edgerton to Bateman is on their A game, the protagonist and the antagonists constantly outsmarting each other makes for an endlessly tense and riveting dynamic, and even the themes themselves present some interesting commentary about military subcontractors, arms deals and the boogeyman of Russian threat to America.

10. Poor Things. The VERY dodgy implications of what is being done to Bella and the unnecessary POV shift from the source material aside, this was a sublime introduction to Lanthimos. Whatever the scene called for, the man and his crew were more than up for the task. Tension, wonder, elation, terror, despair, hopelessness, cynicism, fulfillment, whimsy… all conveyed with a weirdness I suppose is uniquely his. Also, BRAVO to Jerskin Fendrix for that score. Bizarre yet utterly enthralling in how intrusive and odd it is. And to Emma Stone, who can like no other portray a determined, stoically wisecracking British woman.

9. The A(A)-Team. The final Polish offering. I did not expect to love it as much as I did. But when you get a bunch of terribly scarred yet well-meaning people trying to atone for what they did as alcoholics, a plot that combines the whackier sides of Poland and a very emotional main goal, with vibes and directorial style that keeps you glued to the screen no matter what, you get pretty good fucking cinema. My personal standouts are the little monochrome pencil-driven flashback animations that, combined with the protagonists’ voiceover, explain the mistakes they made and the pain they caused.

8. Priscilla. Cailee Spaeny should’ve been nominated for this, no doubt. She is as believable as her character at 14 as she is at 25. Her ability to transition between ages was just phenomenal. Make up team, Jacob Elordi and Sofia Coppola also deserve genuine praise. But my biggest praise for the film lies in the fact that it managed to make a great story without creating a narrative centered around a specific endeavor or event. It’s just a collection of connected events, yet each of them reveals something interesting about the characters or the world they inhabit.

7. Anatomy of a Fall. Probably the most down-to-earth film in the group. It leaves you with a lack of closure, a feeling of strong ambiguity and uncertainty. Which I suppose was the directorial intent. Great performances from everyone (though the one I’d nominate Sandra Hüller for was in Glazer’s, not Triet’s movie), a compelling mystery, and the courtroom scenes… Oh, they were a fucking blast. It was like watching a dead-serious, prosaic, more sincere version of Ace Attorney. Just as much entertainment and dynamism in the scenes, but without AA’s crazy energy. Best hallmarks of the movie’s quality are the fact I could only nitpick the slightly underwhelming cinematography and the grating 50 Cent track.

6. Speak No Evil. You’re probably surprised to see it up here, but I’mma own it. Not only does Speak No Evil use its vague premise to create a ticking bomb of a plot that once goes off, it fucking TEARS the screen to shreds. After that, it also becomes a fucking MASTERCLASS in tension, my whole body was there ready to give out any minute once our protagonists realized the deep shit they were in. Special accolades to James McAvoy, Mackenzie Davis and Scoot McNairy as far as performances go. There are also some well-conveyed themes about generational trauma poisoning people’s souls, the dangers of the inability to say “no” and the depths some will go to justify their actions. Fantastic filmmaking.

5. The Apprentice. I have to applaud Ali Abbasi for managing to keep the story infused with the typical Trumpian undertones of vanity, hedonism and rapaciousness and not losing the emotion in it. The movie forges the spear of depressive truths about Trump’s world and stabs you with it repeatedly. But eventually, the stab just hurts you somewhere lower, existentially. You don’t even feel for Donald anymore, if you ever did in the first place. All that’s left is Roy and Ivana, and they’re both royally screwed. As is America, if the final shot and real life are anything to go by. But hey, at least we got a three-composer-collaboration of a score that is both cohesive and fucking excellent in quality. How about that? (Nominate Dirkov, Holmes and Irvine for the Oscar, you COWARDS!)

4. Conclave. The one movie where my firm expectations regarding its quality were thoroughly fulfilled. When you look at it as a whole, you may come to a conclusion it’s like Oppenheimer, but in a church setting. I mean, I sure did get the impression, considering the sharp, visually clean and orderly directing/editing style, the rhythmically oppressive yet graceful score and the raw yet elegant acting of the performers involved. Fiennes earned his Best Actor nom, no doubt, but I’m secretly hoping for a Best Supporting nom for Carlos Diehz as Vincent Benítez. He sold the man’s honesty, kindness and timidness with such conviction I only doubted it due to a fakeout Berger planted last minute. As far as their characters’ innocence goes, this year only Cailee Spaeny matched Diehz. The movie plays like a purebred conspiracy thriller, questioning everyone’s motives, infusing paranoia and uncertainty into every scene. You have ZERO fucking confusion about the extent to which the Holy See lost its way, because certain frames just scream “This can’t be made right, can IT?!” But the movie’s true genius lies in its twist, because it reframes both the movie’s themes and characters in ways never explicitly stated, yet hard-hitting once inferred. This would’ve been a masterpiece had the secondary antagonist been more fleshed out.

3. Dune Part 2. Denis Villeneuve and Greg Fraser ain’t skipped a single goddamn beat on the production. Hans Zimmer did, but even with more repetition his musical material is top-notch. The movie sure takes a while to get going, but I have nothing but applause for it for how effectively it establishes its antagonist (really crappy how they did very little with him in the end, though), and how the Harkonnenian clusterfuck on Arrakis beautifully falls apart with time. When Paul ascends to Prophet level and goes sicko mode on the establishment, the movie kicks into its highest gear on all levels. We understand everyone’s position in the conflict and what they’re willing to do to achieve their goals. Which makes it so frustrating Emperor Shaddam and Feyd-Rautha do not get nearly enough time to have their political and philosophical perspectives be expressed. But still, the movie is lethally efficient when it comes to… Chani and her disillusionment arc. Not only is she an excellent mirror to the bloodthirsty Gurney and the increasingly fanatical Stilgar, Zendaya turns in some incredibly believable acting that had me rooting for her with no questions. I can’t wait for Messiah, and Shai-Hulud bless Villeneuve’s team!

2. The Zone of Interest. That movie hits on a deeper level. I did not actually comprehend what I saw until I was back home from the theater, and that’s when I started crying. The movie is indeed viciously effective in how much it can tear your heart out without you seeing or realizing it in the first place. Insanely beautiful cinematography, and the score… 3 tracks in the whole movie, yet they’re all fucking Oscar-worthy. Great acting. And the theme of invisibility… it’s clear enough you know what’s the context Glazer applies it to, but also subtle enough everyone will have ideas about what it means to say and which other contexts it can be applied to in real life. Probably the best candidate for 2023’s BP barring Oppenheimer.

1. The Substance. If The Zone of Interest is bold, then Coralie Fargeat’s project is BOLD. Not really in its theme, but in how it’s executed. It’s an attack on the senses, in both a good and bad way. The screen sucks you in and shits you out time and time again. You’re in an abusive relationship with it, just like Liz Sparkle is with The Substance/Sue. Huge props for the trailer, because it fooled me so hard into thinking we’d be getting an individual v individuals/society conflict, while we got an individual v self conflict. I was watching with all my interest as Liz and Sue tried to undermine each other yet being constantly forced to rely on one another, as the situation got worse and worse. It’s not that a person is trying to destroy themself, it’s how extreme the degradation is. The movie knows no fucking restraint sometimes, and in those times the terror can be mixed with perverse glee and karmic satisfaction, gives those times coincide with character punishment, but when it manages to show restraint, the horror stings more profoundly. In 2024 few things in cinema managed to scare the crap out of me, and one of them was Sue smiling hysterically to a mirror as several of her teeth were falling out. The Substance thrives in the hateful and the loving, the gross and the tantalizing, the sinister and the kind. At its heart it’s a story of a woman who could not forgive herself for something she had no control over. You really see it in 3 scenes only, but those 3 scenes are what’s enough to make the movie sincere. Moore and Qualley are insanely convincing. God! Just give it the BP already!



All in all, a great year. I won’t say it’s superior to 2023 or anything, but I think I’d rate The Substance on the same level as Babylon (a delayee from 2022 that topped the 2023 chart), which I suppose is saying something. But now I know one thing for sure. Cinema has become something I’ll probably love forever."	/r/TrueFilm/comments/1hrztwh/looking_back_on_2024_a_cinematic_year_in_review/	https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/1hrztwh/looking_back_on_2024_a_cinematic_year_in_review/

Like the scene wasn't very emotional for you, and then the score kicked in and had you running for the tissues? For a recent one for me, the ending scene of Deadpool and Wolverine wasn't super emotional for me, still sad and all but not sob-worthy, until the choir version of Like a Prayer kicked in. Or the music during the ending of Inception.

Dances with Wolves is a better movie than Goodfellas and deserved to win Best Picture

Pearl Harbour is actually a really good movie. I thought it was cheesy and lame when it came out but it actually one of my favourites now. 

Dunkirk and Oppenheimer are the only Christopher Nolan movies I like, and I actually hate Interstellar. 

Hook is not actually a good movie. We liked it as kids and we rewatch it for pure nostalgia. 

Die Hard 2, Die Hard with a Vengeance and the uncut version of Live Free or Die Hard are all better than Die Hard. 

Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom is the only worthwhile Indiana Jones movie worth revisiting on the regular. 

Paul Verhoeven’s name should be spoken in the same breath as directors like Kubrick and Fincher."	/r/movies/comments/1gdg49l/unpopular_movie_opinions/	https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1gdg49l/unpopular_movie_opinions/
oppenheimer	movies	1ga3flu	1729662903	Finally got around to seeing Oppenheimer and it was…okay..	"I will start by saying that I’m not the biggest fan of historical dramas but I can find myself liking or even loving some from time to time. For instance Lincoln (2012) was one of my favorite movies from that year, probably in my top 5, but even with that said and as a huge fan of Nolan, for some reason Oppenheimer didn’t really do anything for me..

I would like to say, however, that I think the acting and casting is phenomenal and probably the best out of any Nolan movie so far. Josh Hartnett was amazing probably one of my favorite roles I’ve ever seen from him. But in terms of resonance it’s probably overall my least favorite out of any Nolan film. I honestly don’t know exactly why, I just didn’t get anything out of it.

oppenheimer	movies	1g21i4b	1728743842	Watched Oppenheimer again and the thing that sticks out to me with this movie, and Nolan did this brilliantly with Dunkirk, is that the pacing is absolutely flawless. It’s a period movie based off of science and you never feel bored or check your watch.	With Oppenheimer the pacing and the script is so good and the direction is so tight you don’t like you’ve watched a 3 hour movie. Nolan has this talent with his movies, I would say he developed after interstellar, where he finds the right rhymthms where he can make these intricate 2 hours 30 to 3 hour movies wildly entertaining accross multiple genres.

oppenheimer	movies	1fpkzac	1727314649	Favorite Movie by State: fin.	"Day 51: Nevada was Oceans 11, which honestly to me was a dark horse here. Runners up were Casino (my vote) and Fear and Loathing, which I thought would edge out. Oceans 11 is really good but I didn’t know it had this type of love. I need to rewatch. It has been years, and heist movies are great. Maybe part of my shock is Oceans 12 is one of the only movies I have walked out of. Leaving Las Vegas, and Tremors were quite represented as well. 

Nothing to vote for today, but I think I’ll come back next week and we’ll finish US territories. 
I am by no means a cinephile but I love movies, movies of all types! Some made this list. Some of the ones I voted for were Sarah Marshall, The Shining, Tommy Boy, Goodfellas  among others. And Fargo. As far as the Fargo issue, the whole thing woulda been avoided if I just did Minnesota first. 🤷 that whole thing was like an Easter egg for the people who jumped on early. Casino and What About Bob for NH. To me that is as good as movies get. 
Shout out to the shout outs along the way and yesterday. I’ve never engaged with reddit like this and it’s been fun. I’m borderline surprised I made it all the way and only skipped a single day. 

So long. Hasta la vista. Goodnight and good luck. Yippee ki yay. Stay classy. I’ll be right back. 

Also this week I will post a list that is linked. Give me a few days! 

Thanks for following along everybody.

oppenheimer	movies	1fonp8v	1727212733	Favorite Movie by State: Nevada	"Day 51: Nevada

Day 50: California winner is Pulp Fiction, and that got my upvote as well. There are so so many good movies that represent subcultures of California. Such has been true for a few states, but none more than California. But alas, we are picking a governor, not a mayor. There Will be Blood, Heat, T2, Speed, Chinatown, Roger Rabbit, and so many more got in the mix. I am fond of Mid 90s. 

Edit. I messed up. Day 50 winner for California was THE BIG LEBOWSKI not pulp fiction. Both are bangers and I’m cool with that. 

Today is the final state, Nevada. I wanted to end with this because a favorite movie of mine is here and even though it might be odd, Nevada has a spread. Casinos, desert, and history. Sometimes all three. 

I really appreciate the people that have followed along. A few of you hit all 50 days (don’t break your streak today!)

Day 48: Idaho winner was Napoleon Dynamite what a great flick, I haven’t seen in years but when it came out it was so confusing, fun, ambiguous. All the things!! My Own Personal Idaho came in second and I think I’ll watch that. It sounds like a good flick. 

Next is South Carolina. It’s got some history, some beach, some city, and some movies so let’s roll them out.

oppenheimer	movies	1fhqq77	1726443874	Do movie studios know when they’re making “average” or “Oscar worthy” films?	"Movie studios crank movies out consistently, which obviously costs millions of dollars per film. However, many movies’ legacy will be nothing more than 6.0 IMDb rating. Let’s take the movie “I, Robot” as an example. The movie itself is entertaining but very much “average”. So, did 20th Century Fox pitch this movie as an “average” watch, or did they just have an idea that did not play out amazingly?

On the other hand, we have the Oscar winners. I imagine that studios must have an idea of what movies they want to at least be considered for Oscars, so when “Oppenheimer” started filming, did they know they wanted this movie to reach the top stage of cinematography?"	/r/movies/comments/1fhqq77/do_movie_studios_know_when_theyre_making_average/	https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1fhqq77/do_movie_studios_know_when_theyre_making_average/

I thought Ferris Bueller was going to show the hell up here. There’s no denying that Illinois is John Hughs’ town. Home Alone, Breakfast Club they were the most heavily repped. Road to Perdition and the fugitive also got some love.

oppenheimer	movies	1fek54m	1726086177	"The ""Archeological Significance"" of Movie Movies"	"Before I start this, I'm not defending those terrible ""we're repeating a thing another movie said and adding sex, profanity, and/or bodily functions and calling it a joke"" ""parody movies"" that were popular from 2000-2015 (epic movie, disaster movie, superhero movie, vampires suck, etc.) and saying we should still have them, they were pretty much universally bad and we're better off without them ruining the word ""spoof"" and ""parody,"" but I think it's a little irresponsible to say ""and nothing of value was lost,"" because I think there is a ""pop culture archeology interpretation of the time it was made"" that can be observed in them. The other day I was watching The Hungover Games (a ""parody"" of The Hunger Games and The Hangover) as just kind of background noise, and the thing I noticed is that this movie was a collection of every movie and trend that was popular around 2014 (the hunger games and the hangover, but also Ted, The Muppet Movie, Avatar, the Hobbit movies, weird Johnny Depp characters including Tonto from the Lone Ranger movie, and others I'm forgetting), and kind of ONLY movies that were popular at the time, nothing older than like 5 years, and it reminded me of what the cinematic landscape was back 10 years ago. After noticing that it hit me that I had a similar feeling when watching Epic Movie recently, it too name dropped basically everything that was popular around 2007, and for the most part only the newer things, and as I thought about it the same could be said for the others I'm familiar with. So now I'm reminded of a thing an archeologist guest speaker told my class once, ""archeology is the study of a civilization's garbage and piecing together what life was like for those people based on what they used and discarded."" These movies are definitely garbage and were discarded after serving their purpose (if they aren't painfully bad they're immediately forgotten), and for me at least I can step back and say ""yes, I now remember that was a popular thing at the time as was this other thing.""

That's my thesis, now for the discussion part since I need a flair. Now that the ""movie movie"" is largely an artifact of the past, what would a ""current year movie"" be? What recent movies and trends had enough cultural significance to be part of a modern terrible ""parody"" movie? I know Barbie, Oppenheimer, Minions, and Morbius would need to be a part of it, maybe also Deadpool and Wolverine, but what else? Also, what would the title be? Since all my picks have memes with them it would be ""Meme Movie."""	/r/movies/comments/1fek54m/the_archeological_significance_of_movie_movies/	https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1fek54m/the_archeological_significance_of_movie_movies/

oppenheimer	movies	1f970l4	1725490070	"Has anyone noticed how the soundtrack in a movie sometimes ""acts"" for the characters?"	"I noticed it most recently in Bohemian Rhapsody, the music plays and the actors just try to ""react"" to it, and it *seems* like a powerful scene, but the actors aren't really doing anything to help. The same was true of Oppenheimer, Cillian Murphy just put on his weird look while music and special effects whirled about him. I guess it makes for entertainment, but if you watch older movies (I'm talking 60s or before) the actors were the prime focus: it was their job to keep us invested in both the characters and the film in general. Music helped, yes, but it didn't drown out what was going on. I feel that these days, actors know that they have to do less and thus they *do.* A lot of huge actors (male and female) have not too much chops to lean on, and to me it's glaring at times."	/r/movies/comments/1f970l4/has_anyone_noticed_how_the_soundtrack_in_a_movie/	https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1f970l4/has_anyone_noticed_how_the_soundtrack_in_a_movie/

So far we've done:

50 First Dates/Memento

Oppenheimer/ OG Godzilla

Goodfellas/My Blue Heaven

Also, coincidence that some of the cast was in Good Will Hunting (Matt Damon and Casey Affleck) in Oppenheimer?"	/r/movies/comments/1dlnuty/oppenheimers_tone_of_voice/	https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1dlnuty/oppenheimers_tone_of_voice/
oppenheimer	movies	1csppfw	1715792164	What does a movie producer actually do?	"This is a question that I have tried to figure out for years, and have never found a good resource on.

Really, my question is about creative and financial control of movies. Back in the 1950s, you had the studio system. Studios were pretty much factories that made movies. They owned the sets, the cameras, the scripts, the whole shebang. Actors were literally just employees. They would show up one week and be told ""this week, you're acting in a cowboy movie. Next week, you're in a space movie."" Producers were the guys who decided what kind of movies to make. They hired and fired screenwriters, actors, directors, poster artists etc. Therefore, they had creative control over the movie. Sure, if you were a good screenwriter you were more likely to be hired again, but ultimately the studio had the power.

At some point in the 1970s, the studio system broke down. This is where it gets confusing for me. The best explanation I could ever find was that successful creative directors (Stanley Kubrick, George Lucas etc) became more like movie stars. Their name on the poster could draw in crowds and sell the movie. They leveraged this power to get much more creative control over the movies they were making. Suddenly, the studio couldn't just say ""this movie needs more kid characters and a fun talking monkey! Write one in!"" Directors could insist on bringing in their preferred screenwriters, actors etc. 

At this point you have a conflict of control. Presumably the studio are still financing the movie, but they are handing over creative control to someone else. I have heard lots of stories about studio interference on movies. Is this interference coming from producers? Do producers still work for the studio? Or did they form themselves into little independent production companies, who the studio hire like contractors?

Today, I have no idea who really finances and really has creative control over a movie any more. When you watch any mid budget movie, there are half a dozen production companies credited before the main title. Are these companies helping to finance the movie? If so, do they get some say over the script?

Is an auteur-driven movie like Oppenheimer produced in a very different way from something like Barbie? 

I appreciate this is a very long and complex question, but if anyone knows any good resources that explain how all this works, it would be hugely appreciated."	/r/movies/comments/1csppfw/what_does_a_movie_producer_actually_do/	https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1csppfw/what_does_a_movie_producer_actually_do/
oppenheimer	movies	1cjbcc8	1714749762	Godzilla Minus One is the best movie I've seen from 2023.* (non-spoiler thoughts)	"That's right. Fuck off, Oppenheimer. Move aside, Poor Things. Don't call us, Flower Moon, we'll call you. And respectfully get in line right behind GMO, Across the Spider-Verse. Bow to the real king. Bow, ya shits.

Godzilla Minus One is thrilling, devastating, visually glorious, but that's not the best part of it. The best part is the human drama, which is usually an afterthought in these movies. In this one, it shines.

The characters are so well-written and relatable, and the performances were fantastic. It dealt with some heavy subject matter without letting it bog down the narrative. 

Taking place just after WW2, the script really leans into the literally defeated psyche of Japan at the time. There's strong anti-imperialist sentiment against both Imperial Japan and the United States, and I just ate that shit up.

And then we get the Godzilla scenes themselves, and the CGI is second to none. CGI in general has gotten lazy yet busy in recent years, often trying to cover up the lack of quality by overwhelming us with volume. Not this movie, though. I wouldn't quite go so far as to say it looks realistic, we *are* talking about a kaiju movie after all, but it's really freaking close.

The action scenes are WILD, executed to perfection with gradual build-ups before all hell breaks loose. The stakes feel real, and the devastation hits like a gut-punch. It's a monster movie, but it's also a very human one.

Seriously, unless you're someone that hates kaiju films (*cough* weirdo) then I can't see how anyone can NOT love this film. It's nothing short of cinematic ecstasy.

*Let me add that the only major film from 2023 I haven't seen yet is The Boy and the Heron, so let's add a tentative ""so far"" to this post's title"	/r/movies/comments/1cjbcc8/godzilla_minus_one_is_the_best_movie_ive_seen/	https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1cjbcc8/godzilla_minus_one_is_the_best_movie_ive_seen/

I noticed in the movie 'Oppenheimer', that 'Russia' and 'The Soviet Union' were used interchangeably. Given the historical significance and the differences between the two, I'm curious about the reason behind this choice.

oppenheimer	movies	1c8jn7v	1713596415	Anyone else no longer excited by movie explosions or disasters anymore, now that we’ve seen so many real life examples caught on video?	"Lately I’ve found that I’m underwhelmed by movie explosions and disasters. I saw Oppenheimer last fall in IMAX 70mm and the bomb felt so small and unimportant. Recently I’ve felt the same way about the massive action sequences in Dune Part 2, and (not a movie but…) the Fallout TV show. 

There’s been so many real life huge explosions and natural disasters that have been caught on video. I think my brain recognizes the massive scale and tragedy of these real life incidents, and fake movie special effects just aren’t enough to get me excited anymore. Here are some examples of the type of real life events I’m talking about:

Japan tsunami

Tianjin explosion 

Beirut explosion 

9/11 

Florida apartment building collapse

Turkiye earthquake and building collapses

California wildfires 

Brazil dam collapse 

Baltimore bridge collapse 

War footage from Ukraine/Palestine/etc 

Hawaii and Iceland volcanic eruptions

When I’ve seen videos of these events I get emotional thinking about the loss of life and the huge scale of what happened. It feels real and important. But with movie scenes of similar content, I feel nothing… it carries no weight, no significance to me.

Anyone else experience this? Do you think I’ll ever be able to enjoy movies again?"	/r/movies/comments/1c8jn7v/anyone_else_no_longer_excited_by_movie_explosions/	https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1c8jn7v/anyone_else_no_longer_excited_by_movie_explosions/

oppenheimer	movies	1bm21qv	1711225726	"What one thing ruined a movie for you"""	"I had to skip through Oppenheimer because of the music.  I was so glad that I hadn't gone to the movies to watch it because it would have driven me crazy.  I couldn't understand why he basically had a soundtrack playing the entire time.

&amp;#x200B;

I guess I'm sensitive to sound because there have also been times where an actor speaks with vocal fry and I can't take it. 

  
The other kinds of things are implausible suspensions of disbelief.    I'm already willing to accept unrealistic things in movies,  but when they make a point of world building something and then the characters do something incredibly stupid to the point of not being believable,  I give up on the movie pretty quickly.  Example in Prometheus  when the doctors are walking around on a foreign planet messing around with alien life.  Really?   That would be like a biologist deciding to jump in the ocean with a bunch of box jellyfish because they looked cool.

oppenheimer	movies	1bkznee	1711115249	Does anyone know if there wi) be a post-Oscar Oppenheimer DVD coming out	So I realize Oppenheimer was a summer blockbuster, however my understanding is a lot of movies that anticipate winning Academy Awards wait until after they are awarded before sending out a post-AA edition with more scenes and interviews and usually has the best picture print on the cover. Does anyone know if that will be the case with Oppenheimer or is all of the DVD editions for the movie already out on the market	/r/movies/comments/1bkznee/does_anyone_know_if_there_wi_be_a_postoscar/	https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1bkznee/does_anyone_know_if_there_wi_be_a_postoscar/
oppenheimer	movies	1bk4ikf	1711021193	Why are movie reviews so hyperbolic?	I absolutely loved Oppenheimer, but I can’t stop thinking about a review I read before the movie came out to the public which said that “the film itself feels like it becomes poisoned with radiation as it goes along.” I also can’t stop thinking about that one review of All of Us Strangers said that the movie contains haunting imagery that sears itself into the brain. Again, I loved the movie, but I wouldn’t say it had images that seared itself into the brain. These are just a few examples, but I feel like 95% of reviews sound like this. They always operate in extremes and whenever a reviewer loves a movie, they describe it in a way that ultimately exceeds what the actual experience of watching it can possibly feel like. Why are review so hyperbolic?	/r/movies/comments/1bk4ikf/why_are_movie_reviews_so_hyperbolic/	https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1bk4ikf/why_are_movie_reviews_so_hyperbolic/

oppenheimer	movies	1bh2yz3	1710695955	The current criticism of Oppenheimer, it went from people liking/praising, to negative perception now.	"Recently realized there are a lot of people and critics saying bad about Oppenheimer, at first i though this was a consequence of oscars and anything that is awarded in that shit show becomes associated of being a shit movie equally, but its not new as I thought, found youtube critics and comments that have some months; so the oscars is not the reason.

Yet the first reviews and criticisms where positive, but the dichotomy is now that the movie is too complex and the flow of the story isnt focused... which wasnt an argument before but now seems to be a great excuse. (always understood and was able to follow any Nolan movie, only Tenet was so complex that took me 2 viewings to identify the finer details, and yet I do get the criticism of complexity, but its still a quality not an issue)

Other arguments I do sympathize, from people who thought the bomb working would be the big climax of the movie, up too secondary plots that shouldn't be included, or not necessary. I dont agree with these, but at least I get their point of view.

I guess Nolan is also accumulating bad juju from all his previous movies, cause too complex, the sound design, the expectations, etc

\----------------------------------

Im obliviously a fan of Nolan yet that doesnt mean I cant find flaws, and even though I like all his movies that doesnt mean all negative criticism is invalid, all debate is good.

\----------------------------------

EDIT: its not a reddit only issue, stop repeating that in the comments, more sources exist.

oppenheimer	movies	1bf66t7	1710479009	What makes a movie Oscar-worthy?	"Recent Oscar nominated movies Poor Things, Oppenheimer, Everything Everywhere All At Once were a little odd and not to my liking. Am I too much of a simpleton for these types of movies?

I have not seen an Oscar movie that I enjoyed in recent years. Please prove me wrong with a good recent Oscar movie. Btw, I enjoy movies like Mission Impossible, Inception, Wonder Woman, etc."	/r/movies/comments/1bf66t7/what_makes_a_movie_oscarworthy/	https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1bf66t7/what_makes_a_movie_oscarworthy/
oppenheimer	movies	1bd96m8	1710278970	Does a Movie Have to be Good in Any Format (in a theater or at home) to Truly be Good?	"Had a little debate with a friend of mine about the best way to watch movies. While we both agree that the theater is pretty much always the best way to watch any movie, we disagree about what that means for the quality of the film. 

Basically, I said that if someone watched a ""specifically made to be watched in a theater"" movie (think Dune, Oppenheimer, Top Gun: Maverick, etc.) at home on their regular TV with their regular speakers and came away with a poor opinion of the film, I couldn't entirely trust that opinion. I think that certain, very intentional qualities are lost when using a home setup.

She argues that for a movie to be objectively good, it has to be good regardless of medium, assuming that medium isn't broken or otherwise flawed. If watching a movie at home notably diminishes its quality, then it clearly has some major flaw(s).

I don't necessarily *dis*agree with her; the best movies are great no matter the medium. Plus, if a movie turns *bad* at home, then yeah it's clearly flawed. But the ""necessity"" to watch a movie in theaters shouldn't take away from its objective quality, especially if its director specifically made it that way.

**So can a movie that's designed to be watched in a theater (on a big screen, with the best sound) still be an objectively good movie even if watching at home loses what makes it so great in theaters?** What are your thoughts here?"	/r/movies/comments/1bd96m8/does_a_movie_have_to_be_good_in_any_format_in_a/	https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1bd96m8/does_a_movie_have_to_be_good_in_any_format_in_a/

Hey guys! I love doing projects like this just for fun. I love rating and ranking movies and doing brackets. It's a real sweet spot for me. I had this idea the other day so I figured I should pursue it. How this came to be was that I took a look at the most popular movies on Letterboxd, then I split them up into the 8 genres you see above. The seeds were simply determined by how high they were on Letterboxd's popularity list. There was a little bit of fudging with the genres just to make everything fit, but I don't believe there is anything egregiously out of place. For those who want to see all of the seeds broken down, here they are...

oppenheimer	flicks	1bc197v	1710157586	With Oppenheimer sweeping at the Oscars this year, where does it rank in Nolan's filmography?	I saw a lot of people saying when it came out that it is actually his magnum opus. Honestly I feel like that is recency bias, but all opinions are valid I suppose. Personally I still consider Interstellar to be his best film, but Oppenheimer is certainly firing on all cylinders and I wouldn't be surprised if in a few years I might actually reconsider my choice. I'd put it above Dunkirk but below The Dark Knight.	/r/flicks/comments/1bc197v/with_oppenheimer_sweeping_at_the_oscars_this_year/	https://www.reddit.com/r/flicks/comments/1bc197v/with_oppenheimer_sweeping_at_the_oscars_this_year/
oppenheimer	TrueFilm	1b6k1fv	1709581204	Dune Part 2: Review (Unpopular)	"**""A great man doesn't seek to lead. He's called to it. And he answers. And if your answer is no, you'll still be the only thing I ever needed you to be. My son.”**

A beautiful and memorable line of dialogue from the first instalment of this series; delivered by none other than the ubiquitous Oscar Isaac, whose poetic presence is deeply missed in this film. 

**Disclaimer:** Me drinking out of a 2L water bottle while watching the Fremen scavenge for water ironically served as a microcosm for my disconnectedness from the film. 

Denis Villeneuve has earned his place next to Nolan’s as the great directors of our time. If Nolan is the master teller, as I wrote in my original Oppenheimer review, then Denis is the master shower. He’s made no secret of his “hate” for dialogue, going as far to say that “Dialogue is for theatre and television. I don't remember movies because of a good line, I remember movies because of a strong image. I'm not interested in dialogue at all.” I’m all for directors directing with their own biases, and through their own lenses, but that was pretentious. A director should give careful attention to every aspect of filmmaking, while privileging those that deserve it. But here, Denis has unapologetically disregarded screenwriting as important, and the result—a weak and uncompelling script. 

For me, one fundamental trope of the fantasy/sci-fi genre is the poetry that it entails. Rutger Hauer’s monologue during the closing scenes of **Blade Runner (1982)**, and Luke's final exchange with his father in **Return of the Jedi (1983)** are just a few examples. Even in book to screen adaptations like **LOTR**, Peter Jackson made it a point to add a layer of wisdom through poetry to the characters who deserved it. Villeneuve's writing peaks with “May thy knife chip and shatter,” and his handful of lines in the language of “Chakobsa,” created by novelist Frank Herbert, and not because their moving either, but because they sound cool. 

The comparisons to **Star Wars** need to end. Chalamet and Zendaya’s on screen romance pales in comparison to that of Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher. Never are we truly gripped or enticed into their love story the way we were in a galaxy far far away. 

So no, I didn’t feel that urge to get up and run head first into every adventure that the world throws at me like I do after watching **Star Wars, Harry Potter,** or **LOTR.** But there’s a great many stills from the film that could be hung in a museum; and that’s what Denis set out to achieve. I’m part of the small minority that didn’t think this film lived up to the hype, and I’m glad. Because as one of my best friends put it, Denis’ career deserves its flowers.

oppenheimer	TrueFilm	19dgodx	1705986422	Parents of toddlers, how do you make the time (and energy) to watch what you want to watch. How often do you go to the movie theater?	"I wanted to initially post this on one of the parenting subreddits, but I feel like the parents really committed to movies are here and may offer more pointed commiseration, tips, and a light at the end of the tunnel.

My wife and I had Movie Pass, followed by Sinemia, and then Regal Unlimited. We'd watch a new movie every weekend in theaters, during the week once or twice a month, and a movie every single night. I think we'd hit 400 in a year (rewatches and new). The pandemic changed that a lot and we didn't get a lot of theater time in before I was the only one able to sit through a movie and by then it wasn't really fun.

Our beautiful toddler, who I love more than spike itself, is 19 months now, but his sleep time (read: about 45 minutes to 1 hour after we put him in a crib and can safely finish the day's chores an start a feature without waking him up) is too late for a standard 2 hour movie, let alone anything longer. I finally got to watch Mulholland Drive after hanging on to my new purchase since November and paid for it the next morning when I finished at 11:30 and had to wake up at 5.

I've got a stack of about 25 new 4k discs that have been waiting for many months to be watched because we're down to 2 movies a week if we get lucky. Sometimes we just relent and finish a 2 hour movie over two nights. 

Oppenheimer, Flower Moon, Drive My Car, Everything Everywhere...., all features that have been too long to do in one sitting. I like long movies, I like finishing them in one go, I resent every single person enjoying the renaissance of long features right now.

So I guess I've got two pointed questions- 1.) is there a site that just lets you split a movie into ideal break points if you tap out at 45 minutes because you're too weakened by the day? and 2.) how do you enjoy what was once the central part of your night now that it's a lot more rare than it used to be?"	/r/TrueFilm/comments/19dgodx/parents_of_toddlers_how_do_you_make_the_time_and/	https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/19dgodx/parents_of_toddlers_how_do_you_make_the_time_and/
oppenheimer	TrueFilm	199ih2i	1705555249	Oppenheimer (2023): Told rather than felt	"***“As directors, we bring people together, and we try and get them to give their best.”***

Christopher Nolan said of his own Golden Globe victory. And for all the people he brought together for this film, one can only applaud him. He quite literally has Academy-award winning actors in leading roles throwing themselves at the opportunity to make a cameo in his film. The gravity he has in the film industry is evident, he is revered by his peers. I can only imagine what it’s like to work on his set and receive his direction. 

Let me start with the fact that this is an objectively good movie, worthy of the praise and awards it is receiving. Nolan’s first true jump into the genre of non-fiction and autobiography (**Dunkirk, 2017** being the exception) shows us that he possesses generational directorial range; not that anyone raised the question. 

That being said however, he is a slave to his own style. 

Nolan is much more of a teller than a shower, and his strength lies in his writing; as it always has. Dr. Oppenheimer was a complicated man, and the mise en scène Nolan creates clearly serves as a microcosm. We are constantly taken from scene to scene confronting different themes, including: science, politics, a mix of the two, espionage, greed, adultery, morality, guilt, and parenthood, or rather lack thereof. He touches on all of them, but never gives his audience a chance to truly digest them. If you stop for a scene to think about the last one, you’re probably missing key dialogue and important elements of another storyline, and entirely different theme; a key reason why his films are enhanced on every rewatch. It is impossible not to feel the weight of Dr. Oppenheimer’s story, it encompasses one of the greatest injustices the world has ever seen. For me at least, I left the theatre in distress because of the tragedy of the story, rather than Nolan’s portrayal of it.  

From my perspective, the film could have benefited from some breathing room, and scenes of downtime that let you sit and absorb the scene you had just watched. And my sentiments stem from my preference to feel a story, rather than be told one. But who’s not to say; had Nolan included these periods of less activity and less stimulation, shortened his list of themes to allow the audience to digest more in the moment, and made the movie I would have preferred, that others would not have criticized him for oversimplifying, undermining key details and events, and being untrue to the book **(American Prometheus, 2005).** I’m a Nolan fan. He brought my friends and I together to watch and debate this film over the last 7 months. My criticism does not take away from my adoration. I think once everyone realizes that you can both commend AND critique any form of art, we’ll get closer to our own truths."	/r/TrueFilm/comments/199ih2i/oppenheimer_2023_told_rather_than_felt/	https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/199ih2i/oppenheimer_2023_told_rather_than_felt/
oppenheimer	flicks	18vdaem	1704045780	A Very Long, Detailed Ranking of (Almost) Every Movie I Watched in 2023	"29. Extraction 2 - God, what a waste of time. Hardly any character was compelling, the movie scared with its visual blandness, action itself underwhelmed. One of the characters’ death scene was so overdone I laughed. Now, mind you, I almost NEVER laugh at death in movies, so that should give you an example of how mediocre this shit was.   
28. Pan Samochodzik i Templariusze/Mr. Car and the Knights Templar - this is the first non-American movie and the first Polish one. Brace yourselves, you’re going to see quite a few of these. In short, the movie is fairly insulting to the original books, does nothing with the semi-interesting reinterpretation of the character, provides some very clunky characterization and semi-decent action. I’d say its most redeeming quality is the fact that its nonsensical execution made for hilarious comedy sometimes.  
27. Knights of the Zodiac - this finally had proper visuals, but the plot was more confusing. The inciting incident itself doesn’t make sense! Why does Athena, the goddess of wisdom and “just” war possess a random girl and intend to destroy the world? Well, you will never know because fuck the audience. It’s amazing how lacking almost everything is and how utterly formulaic the movie is at times. Didn’t help that the bigger caliber actors were wasted.  
26. Akademia Pana Kleksa/Kleks Academy - the first non-American movie. A valiant if lacking effort to revive the world and characters of a classic Polish book for children. Overall, I’d say this is something between a remake, a reboot, a sequel and a prequel to the original book. So we already have a mess. The pacing is very uneven, the acting kind of works, the scenery and visuals kind of slay occasionally, overall the technical execution does a lot of heavy lifting. But the heavy-handed themes (even if praiseworthy in concept) and very clunky dialogue combined with questionable editing brings this down quite a bit.  
25. The Marvels - another very confused movie that wastes most of its prominent characters. I feel very sorry for Brie Larson and Zawe Ashton, they deserved a better movie. A longer, darker one. I would also feel sorry for Iman Vellani, but she slayed and her character, Kamala Khan, was actually written engagingly and consistently. The visuals provide some nice views from time to time, there is overall creativity and a vision to all this, but it all feels too disjointed, rushed, undercooked. The result is a film with some heart, comedic beats and spectacle that will somewhat keep your attention. But nothing more.  
24. Creed III - Maybe it was my mistake to go for this without watching the two previous movies, but I digress. The movie is overall well executed, has some nice tension, I like Donnie and Dame as characters, but I just… don’t have a whole lot to say about it. It’s a nicely done, inoffensive, a little bland, but fine movie.  
23. You People - contrary to almost everyone around, I like this movie. I found Ezra and Amara’s relationship believable, Julia Louis Dreyfus and Eddie Murphy did well as the oppositely annoying parents to each of the protagonists, the humor had me laughing heartily at times and the movie even drops some truth bombs at times.  
22. Mafia Mamma - a surprisingly well-realized fish-out-of-water comedy. Toni Collette fit the main character like a glove, she works amazing as this super driven yet frantic woman who was pulled into murky mafia shit. The supporting characters and antagonists are likeable, interesting and well motivated. The movie doesn’t do much blunders, it’s not really great but it works fine for what it sets out to achieve.  
21. R.M.N./Electromagnetic Resonance - this time we dip our fingers in Eastern Europe, Romania specifically. The acclaimed director Cristian Mungiu sets forth a very atmospheric and engrossing piece of political/social commentary that succeeds for the most part. Most, because the protagonist is almost completely disconnected from the drama of two Asian immigrants trying to work and acclimate to a remote Romanian village. The movie sometimes lost its focus, but when it had it, it worked wonders in its uncompromising desire to examine modern Romanian society.  
20. Kryptonim Polska/Codename Poland - the penultimate motion picture from my homeland in this ranking. Gotta say, I did not expect this movie to be as good as it was. It’s a pretty straightforward if insanely biting piece of political satire. Shit had me HOLLERING with laughter at how well it ridiculed the stupid crap we Poles pull these days. The characters were well realized, and I especially appreciate the antagonists effortlessly switching between comedic mooks to actual intimidating nationalists. The movie overall succeeds in broad tone shifts.   
19. Beau Is Afraid - while I believe Ari Aster had every right to put everything he did in the movie, sometimes he just overdid it. The craziness was well-presented, but sometimes the film just behaved insane for the sake of it. A balls-tripping adventure is very cool but can sometimes get nauseating and overdone. Still, the movie engrossed me with its striking aesthetics, delightfully unhinged characters and some deep themes. I just wish he didn’t turn &gt;!Mona, Beau’s mom and!&lt; the movie’s main antagonist, into a mouthpiece that spelled everything out in a damn monologue. The ending, however? Shit was right up my alley. It was subtle enough to not look on the nose but explicit enough to be immediately understandable. It felt grim, but was also a supremely fitting conclusion to the movie and Beau himself.  
17. The Flash - this movie somehow manages to be more insane than BIA. And yet it overall is somewhat better. I was initially harsh on the score, but it grew on me with time and I can safely say Benjamin Wallfisch did a good job. The acting slays, Ezra Miller, his behavior notwithstanding, is Barry Allen to me, maybe as much as Grant Gustin. EM portrayed both Barry 1 and 2 perfectly, Ben Affleck put in a very good if brief performance as DCEU Batman, everyone else did fine as well. Barry 2 is a fantastic character that you root for, get annoyed by and feel sorry for, experiencing believable growth and development in a super engaging way. The effects somewhat suck balls, but the overall cinematography and direction make up for it. However, the movie FLOUNDERS hard in the 3rd act and it's due to it that I cannot call the Flash anything more than good.  
16. The Killer - a very well paced and elegantly executed thriller from David Fincher. Fun cinematography, another compelling performance from Fassbender. Also liked the themes of the movie and the protagonist’s arc. Overall, a movie with somewhat high highs and kinda low lows.   
15. John Wick: Chapter 4 - as emotionally flat as this movie is, I really like it. The visuals are insane for a simple hitman movie, the action, even if self-indulgent, is overall top notch, the actors give it their all and the pacing maintains a steady flow that makes for an enjoyable watching experience. Maybe if the screenplay was more thematically and emotionally loaded I’d crank it up a bit…  
14. Luther: The Fallen Sun - surprised me, because certain parts of the beginning jarred me. However, the movie soon turned into a high-octane but restrained and somewhat grounded thriller that plays with some timely themes. All Andy Serkis, Idris Elba and Cynthia Erivo give great performances, with the shoutout to the latter, she did great in the 3rd act especially. Lorne Balfe goes INSANE with a score that manages to be inspiring, tense, menacing and soulful. Shit is crazy underrated. The action in this movie was also very well executed.  
13. Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny - the first great movie on the list. Somehow, bringing back the familiar elements from the previous Indy films did not feel jarring, but rather in-place. I felt Helena was rather charismatic and properly developed as a character, the spin Mangold put here on the Nazis provides a very fresh angle that I really enjoyed, the action doesn’t lose the old Spielbergian energy and liveliness and the last 10 minutes are just beautiful. The conclusion to Indiana Jones and Harrison Ford’s tenure in the role touched me deeply. I personally believe this is the best conclusion an old Indy could have gotten.  
12. The Pale Blue Eye - This rather slow burn of a movie stuns with fascinating shots of a wintery New York and some rather immaculate acting. The final payoff with Bale’s character, August Landor, makes for a supremely rewarding ending, if incredibly dark. I also enjoyed Harry Melling’s portrayal of Edgar Allan Poe and the semi-psychedelic vibe maintained throughout the plot.  
11. El Puño del Cóndor/The Fist of the Condor - a surprisingly well-made Chilean martial arts film. Marko Zaror shines as the actor playing the lead and the antagonist, as well as the combat choreographer behind the fight scenes. Ernesto Espinoza, the writer-director of the film, presents an atmospheric and energetic 80 minute flick which combines high-octane Latino martial arts with spiritual themes, leading to a resolution with the Hoist By His Own Petard trope. While a fine trope in of itself, it is cranked up to awesome levels by the INSANE execution of it as writing, juxtaposition and cinematography combine to create a moment of pure filmmaking magic. Definite recommendation!  
10. The In-Laws/Teściowie - the final Polish film on the list. I expected a semi-serious comedy in a confined setting, what I got was an absurdly captivating escalation drama. Accompanied, I should add, by inspired performances from the 4 lead actors, incredibly atmospheric cinematography and a string of mysteries and reveals that kept me engaged and thrilled. Very strong writing, especially with the ending twist.  
9. Maestro - this is the highest ranked movie I have mixed feelings about. Sometimes, it lacks focus, is incredibly on-the-nose and kinda beats about the bush. But most of the time it gives a compelling insight into the relationship of Leonard Bernstein and Felicia Montealegre. Cooper and Mulligan both shine as the leads, and their performances improve as their characters age. The displays of Bernstein’s musical skills, as sparse as they were, felt incredibly telling and impactful. The camera went CRAZY, Matthew Libatique deserves an Oscar nom for the almost painting-like visual look he crafted with Cooper for the movie. And Bernstein’s music befitted the overall pic utterly. This is a case of very high highs outmatching low lows.  
8. Napoleon - screw the critics, this movie won me over. I was kind of waiting for it, hoping Ridley Scott would be unapologetic in his portrayal of the emperor. And he was. Napoleon was portrayed as such a vainglorious shitheel, I could not believe my eyes. I was utterly giddy at how the movie effortlessly switched between satire and drama while still remembering to get me to care for the two leads. Great performances by Phoenix and Kirby. FANTASTIC direction and photography for the battles of Toulon and Austerlitz. Impressive score by Martin Phipps. Wow!  
7. BlackBerry - a movie about phones and the communication market, boring? You’d think so, but this one is actually sort of a tour de force. Stylized with retro aesthetics, brimming with unmistakable energy and personality, BlackBerry takes us on a captivating journey of the titular phone and the people who made it, their rise and their fall. Glenn Howerton and Jay Baruchel shine as the two leads, Jim Balsille and Mike Lazaridis, whose relationship reminded me of RDJ and Cillian Murphy as Lewis Strauss and Julius Robert Oppenheimer. Except this is kind of a different spin, and here, one of the protagonists becomes like the other over time, instead of becoming their opposite. It’s very engaging to watch. But the highest praise is reserved for Matt Johnson, director, screenwriter and main supporting actor of the film, who realized a tense yet comedic experience that brilliantly showcases the chaotic and unforgiving landscape of big business.  
6. Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes - I had moderate expectations for this one, and shit man, it surpassed them with flying colors! Strong performances all around, with special shoutouts to the two leads playing characters that can’t be easily put into boxes and the gloriously hammy Viola Davis. The movie shines through its atmosphere that sucks you in and themes which infuse the conflict with meaning and make you care about the characters’ fate. Overall, a success on almost all fronts.  
5. Pamfir - No Country For Old Men in Ukraine. However, let me be bold and say this is supremely better than the disappointing NCFOM. While it mirrors the Coens’ movie in showcasing the dissatisfaction and futility of life, it doesn’t spit in my face for being invested in the main characters. The leads are also very human and likeable, and the lack of music somehow works. But Pamfir’s biggest strength is its goddamn visual panache. It’s shot in a very believable and naturalistic yet riveting manner. It makes excellent use of natural scenery and light, showcasing the beauty of Ukraine and coming off as stylized enough to provide a greatly immersive experience.  
4. Barbie - a simple, but very thematically interesting and entertaining exercise in social satire. Love its use of montages and visual storytelling, love the themes behind the movie and the performances of the actors. Ken is a goddamn outstanding character, and Ryan Gosling 100% deserves his Oscar nom. The music is also wicked good when it comes to it, and the movie overall gave me a fun and creative experience that also made me think of certain things.  
3. Oppenheimer - Christopher Nolan just don’t miss, man. He don’t miss at all. Oppenheimer is a fascinating, staggering watch that combines multiple time periods with grace and panache, weaving them together into a compelling character study. Murphy’s Oppenheimer and RDJ’s Strauss are some of the best characters of the decade, and I was more than enthralled by their methodical, gradual evolution over time. Ludwig Goransson puts forward masterful soundtrack pieces as if it was just another Thursday for him, Hoyte Van Hoytema stuns with detailed and crisp yet stylized cinematography, and Jennifer Lame keeps the movie’s pace and energy intact in the editing. This movie is exactly the biopic we need and deserve. The piece de resistance of 2023 cinema.  
2. Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 - James Gunn’s magnum opus. It was moving, hilarious, tense, fun and grandiose. Despite the plot being fairly straightforward, this movie is anything but simple, as it carefully concludes the development of several recurring characters and brings us a fantastic villain in the flesh of the High Evolutionary. John Murphy proves a worthy replacement for Tyler Bates as the main composer, Henry Braham creates visuals that wow despite the muted colors and I don’t even have to say anything about the outstanding practical effects/makeup/prosthetics work, do I? Also, Rocket Raccoon, who is undoubtedly one of the best and most fleshed out characters in the MCU.  
1. Babylon - what an unbelievably outstanding piece of CINEMA. Jesus. Not only does it have three fully developed leads that I all cared for and rooted for, a supporting cast that can both amuse and move you but also a visual layer that is a goddamn moving painting. With just this movie, Linus Sandgren rose above almost any Hollywood cinematographer. The acting is fantastic, the narrative is thrilling and keeps you interested in further developments, the movie switches flawlessly between comedy, tension and emotion. It even has a bloody chase scene that is in fact one of the best in my memory. It is a damning critique of cinema as an industry and a love letter to it as an art form. All brought together by Damien Chazelle’s expert direction and Justin Hurwitz’s masterful soundtrack. MASTERPIECE!

oppenheimer	TrueFilm	18tzxiy	1703890429	A Tale of Two Movie Experiences	"I just rewatched Killers of the Flower Moon, and it's hands down my favourite movie of 2023, or maybe even the last 5 years. I also caught Oppenheimer, which got better critical acclaim, box office, and runs at a faster pace, but there's something about Flower Moon that gives me chills.

Both are based on true stories, and both are fairly accurate, but Scorsese's movie connects me to the characters in a different way. The deliberate pace, the epic Western background score, lingering shots, De Niro's charisma, Gladstone's powerful performance, the symbolism – it all adds up.

I saw both in theatres, and the first time for each was amazing. Loved Oppenheimer so much that I booked a second show with my dad, but it didn't hit the same.

Missed the chance to see Flower Moon a second time due to early campus commitments but recently caught it on Apple TV with Dad, and it still gives me chills, even more than the first time. Ready for a third viewing with Mom.

However, a colleague and his friends, fans of Wolf of Wall Street, found Flower Moon disappointing in theatres. While it lacks the kinetic energy of Wall Street, the different subject matter deserves a unique approach.

I guess one reason why I loved it so much is because of the time it takes to get comfortable with the setting. The pacing makes you feel just as powerless as the Osage, and that's why I could connect with the characters so well. Oppenheimer, I feel, was too fast, that it didn't give me any time to connect with anything. It did keep the movie engaging the first time, but after I knew the plot, I guess I just wanted to know the characters better, which the movie didn't allow. Maybe it's better if I read the biography American Prometheus, then I could appreciate the movie

oppenheimer	TrueFilm	18q7gcb	1703463698	Little Raindrop Detail in Oppenheimer I haven’t seen people talk about	"Throughout the film there is an obvious motif that drops of water represent nuclear explosions/chain reactions. He sees them in the puddle at the start, in the pond at the end when dreading Armageddon, and in the world map at the AEC meeting when Bourden talks to him about strapping nukes to rockets.

What I haven’t seen people talk about is how when Oppenheimer is asked ‘if he ever saw Jean Tatlock again’, which he didn’t, Oppenheimer thinks about a single drop of water rippling in the bathtub she died in.

This singular drop represents the metaphorical last time Oppenheimer “saw” Jean. He “saw” her in the first ever nuclear explosion—the first drop the world ever encountered. The drop is trinity. The last time Oppenheimer saw Jean was when he looked at the flames of Trinity and recalled how he said “I am become death”, to her. 

Notice, it is the only raindrop moment in the film that shows just one isolated/singular drop—all others show many drops falling among others in a “chain reaction”, further evidencing this drop represents Trinity—a singular explosion.

The cut to the drop during the questioning sequence further ties the Jean and Trinity together, and imo, helps justify a sex scene many have called goofy.

Edit: IIRC we also hear the rumbling of the feet in the gymnasium in the sequence, which is used frequently in the film to symbolize the unyielding march of nuclear armament, only further solidifying the parallel between Jean and Trinity (what reason would Oppenheimer have to think about the shuffling feet at the gym [nuclear progress] when asked about the last time he saw Jean—unless he directly correlates her to nuclear weapons. To the first drop in the bathtub).

In sum/perhaps better worded terms: the singular raindrop in Jean’s tub represents the first nuclear explosion—Trinity—and Oppenheimer thinks about it when asked about the last time he saw Jean BECAUSE it is the last time he “saw” Jean"	/r/TrueFilm/comments/18q7gcb/little_raindrop_detail_in_oppenheimer_i_havent/	https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/18q7gcb/little_raindrop_detail_in_oppenheimer_i_havent/

"My Dinner with Andre is probably the film I would recommend as the most accessible ""high brow"" film. At the end of the day, the film is just a long conversation between two old aquaintances who haven't seen each other in a while, but it goes into some deeper themes. 


A film like The Matrix back in the day sparked a lot of imaginations and probably caused a lot of people to start looking at the world a bit differently (I know it did with me) even though some film snobs probably look down on it due to the over-the-top wire-fu action scenes.

oppenheimer	TrueFilm	16zviiz	1696445987	"Christopher Nolan's editing style on ""Oppenheimer"" (2023) - did it ruin the film?"	"I honestly do not get why Christopher Nolan shot the film the way he did - simply put, the film is cut too fast.

Most shots barely last longer than 3 or 4 seconds. It is hard to keep up with the dialogue of a given scene where the shots of the scene just pass by. This is especially problematic for a film like Oppenheimer, where the dialogue is obviously very important.

I've also noticed that Nolan shot too much coverage in a lot of scenes. Instead of holding a simple master shot and then cutting to a close-up of a character every now and then, Nolan chose to shoot a sizeable chunk of scenes from a lot of angles. Why not just set up a master shot and let it play out for at least seven or eight seconds, and then go to shot-reverse-shot when it is *actually* necessary, instead of constantly relying on it?

Master shots have one clear advantage over close-ups when it comes to acting - on master shots, an actor can use body language to convey emotion. With close-ups, an actor is mostly stuck with their face to convey emotion, which is a roadblock for them to comprehensively convey the then-current emotional state of the character they are portraying.

Did the low average shot length of *Oppenheimer* ruin the movie for you? If you were directing the film, would you have gone for a slower editing style?"	/r/TrueFilm/comments/16zviiz/christopher_nolans_editing_style_on_oppenheimer/	https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/16zviiz/christopher_nolans_editing_style_on_oppenheimer/
oppenheimer	TrueFilm	16udcq9	1695900258	Wellerstein (leading historian on nuclear weapons) on Oppenheimer	"https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/fact-fiction-and-the-father-of-the-bomb-on-christopher-nolans-oppenheimer/

Surprised this wasn't linked before. Alex Wellerstein runs NUKEMAP as well as the excellent website https://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/about-me/ This is a very worthwhile read imo.

The article discusses the ""accuracy"" of Oppenheimer as well as what Nolan was trying to do with the movie and what he achieved.

&gt; When I learned that Nolan was making an Oppenheimer film, the first question that came to mind was: why? None of Nolan’s other films suggested an interest in historical biography, and if anything, the most frequent critique of Nolan is his indifference to deep characterization. Since I have been thinking about J. Robert Oppenheimer for some 20 years, I can certainly understand his allure, but to Nolan? I worried that Oppenheimer’s inner complexity and subtlety, the very thing that historians find interesting about him, would be turned into a simplistic parody (the brilliant scientist, the weeping martyr, the weapons maker, etc.).
&gt;
&gt; And so, upon watching the film, I was impressed by how much Nolan as writer, and Murphy as actor, tried to avoid this particular snare. Murphy’s Oppenheimer exudes tension, intelligence, and, crucially, insecurity. He is not portrayed as a hero, or someone you would want to emulate, or potentially even someone you would like to have dinner with. He is smart, yes, but he’s also a show-off, a know-it-all whose need to be considered “brilliant” by others drives him at times to be impressive, cruel, and thoughtless. It is remarkable that Nolan and Murphy went in this direction. One gets the sense that Nolan thinks Oppenheimer is important, and interesting, but not that he likes Oppenheimer. This may have helped him avoid the most seductive trap of all: trying to make Oppenheimer a relatable everyman.

...

&gt; When Secretary of Commerce Henry Wallace met Oppenheimer a few months after the end of World War II, he described a man in great distress. “I never saw a man in such an extremely nervous state as Oppenheimer,” Wallace wrote in his diary. “He seemed to feel that the destruction of the entire human race was imminent. […] The guilt consciousness of the atomic bomb scientists is one of the most astounding things I have ever seen.” (The result of this meeting was Wallace’s arranging of Oppenheimer’s disastrous encounter with Truman in the Oval Office.) Oppenheimer was, at this point, desperately trying to advocate for a world in which no nation would have nuclear weapons, using the horrors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and the nascent plans for even worse weapons, as an impetus for remaking the entire nature of war and international relations. He did not succeed; we live in his worst nightmare, where multiple states have civilization-killing quantities of nuclear arms ready for deployment at a moment’s notice.
&gt;
&gt; This harried, eschatological prophet, desperately trying to invoke what influence he has in order to convince the people with real power not to use that power poorly, is the Oppenheimer that Murphy channels, and that Nolan is interested in. I have always thought that Prometheus was the wrong reference point, one that Oppenheimer himself would have strongly rejected. Oppenheimer was no champion of humanity, and his punishment was not for having “stolen fire,” but for more mundane transgressions, including those of the flesh, a fact that Nolan’s film emphasizes. In his Bhagavad Gītā reference, Oppenheimer renders himself as Prince Arjuna, who was cajoled by something great and terrible into taking on a burden he did not want. Even that feels incomplete, for while Oppenheimer was initially willing to go to war, he was afterwards gripped with an intense desire to push things in a different direction. Perhaps we need to invent a new, modern mythology for such a figure; perhaps that is what Nolan is really trying to do. Let’s hope the film will be remembered for this, and not just for its curious juxtaposition with the other summer blockbuster, Greta Gerwig’s (excellent) Barbie.

Wellerstein's article aligns well with a lot of what I felt when I left the theatre, that the film was a lot about Oppenheimer's mix of ""playing a character"" and what he genuinely feels, and fears. When he tells the scientists to keep on building the nuke even after Hitler's death, was he bullshitting, or did he convince even himself that the bomb would end war? I recall the fun conversation towards the start where the guy tells Oppenheimer to ditch the military uniform and ""play the best version of himself""...

This means also that we have yet another movie from Nolan that is secretly about film making..."	/r/TrueFilm/comments/16udcq9/wellerstein_leading_historian_on_nuclear_weapons/	https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/16udcq9/wellerstein_leading_historian_on_nuclear_weapons/
oppenheimer	TrueFilm	16mxke3	1695145783	Oppenheimer - A Soundtrack In Analysis	"Composed of 24 tracks, Ludwig Göransson’s Oppenheimer soundtrack is a quite fascinating and amazingly made work of art. Apart from its incredible technical execution, it offers a wide range of themes, emotions and characterization.

One thing you may notice about the first third of the soundtrack is that it’s very much reminiscent of a first act in a narrative, as it’s composed of introductory themes of the movie’s characters, much like the first act introduces the characters themselves. It establishes the themes for Julius Oppenheimer (yes, I’m calling him that), Lewis Strauss, Jean Tatlock, Kitty Oppenheimer, Leslie Groves and the Manhattan Project/Los Alamos.

Fission begins in a calm, peaceful, yet unnerving manner. During an atmospheric, continuous violin and brass (akin to a live recording of an orchestra warming up) section the track begins to find its footing with the harp gently sliding in. It plays the two note Oppenheimer motif, which will be repeated by it a couple more times in the track and the overall score , but will mostly be heavily reprised by strings to a really melancholic effect, and synths to multiple emotional responses. To be sure, the strings themselves do take over here after a while and maintain the two-note theme. It moves smoothly and gallantly, like the glissando it is. This peaceful, but eerie part slowly descends into straight up horror as the violins begin resembling raid sirens. It’s the consequences motif. Snyths enter the audio space soon after, and after the violin fades into the background, they continue playing in two different keys and tempos. This is what I like to call the ‘tortured genius’ mini-motif. As it gets stronger, the classic two-note by the violin gently reappears in its typical harrowing fashion, and soon this incredibly powerful piece ends. The movie version splits it in three, the first part additionally employing the feet stomping sounds to build up a powerful crescendo complimenting the monumental imagery of the opening scene.

Can You Hear The Music, the second Oppenheimer theme is an introduction of another facet of the character. In Fission, we could hear the promise of a tale of a tortured genius; the premise was on display. But Göransson and Nolan did not hesitate to put the passionate intellectual at the front either. Regardless of its alleged 21 tempo changes, the song really does shift gears a good couple of times, which, aside from sounding really cool and pleasing I believe is meant to signify Julius’ mind entering new levels of understanding as he does indeed hear “the music” and comprehends physics better. The two-note motif is sounded again, but this time it is unabashedly joyful, passionate and expressed by synths. We’re capable of feeling the same wonder and awe Oppenheimer felt when “getting” science and physics, and it all masterfully conveyed by Göransson and his team.

A Lowly Shoe Salesman serves as a musical introduction to Lewis Strauss. Led by strings and a harp - two instruments very emblematic of the movie’s auditory structure overall - this piece starts off quite serene and peaceful, only to hit less positive notes, especially when the strings play the main two-note leitmotif for Strauss. The character’s lack of self-confidence, his insecurity, and his issues with self-images are communicated remarkably well through Goransson’s score. The theme descends into somber, and even bordering on menacing territory as we see Strauss get slighted and treated a bit unseriously by Oppenheimer. All in all, this is probably the most sympathetic the movie and the music treat Lewis.

Quantum Mechanics I have not much to say about, both the science field and the track itself. It’s just basically Can You Hear The Music, but slowed down and with some additional instruments. Sure, it’s meant to work in accordance with Oppenheimer laying the knowledge he’s learned over the years out to the students, as the previously frenetic and rapid melody takes on a far more gentle and restrained approach, as you’d think a professor would when explaining complex matters to his understudies.

Gravity Swallows Light introduces the little “consequences” theme very deftly, to later have it drowned out with the siren violins and some additional synth touches. Once it ceases, the theme continues in an organic fashion. Its use in the movie is curious, because it also plays in scenes with Jean Tatlock, or at least the first one. Well, in fact Jean IS a consequence of Robert’s urges and carelessness. The theme later switches into higher gear, synths and traditional orchestra working very well together. It is as much an expression of Oppenheimer’s admiration for the stars and the inner workings of the universe as it is an expression of his passion for Jean.

Meeting Kitty was surely a great moment in Julius’ life, and it is one musically. The piano and violins showcase the lady's unhappy, unfulfilled, but undeniably steadfast soul. And also the joy of her and Robert's time together. This is quickly cut short by the somber melody of Robert leaving Jean (the harp is heard again). The final piece ominously describes the first communist allegations against the main character.

Groves - a serious, yet undeniably positive theme, describing General Leslie Groves with accuracy. There is antagonism there, but also good intentions. The theme shall return in even more grim pieces as a ray of hope, given Groves becoming Oppenheimer's ally later on.

Manhattan Project - the first dozen seconds really describe what is happening at that point in the movie: scientists from around America and the world banding together to build a horrifying weapon of mass destruction. At 0:28 the Los Alamos theme slides gently, and the rhythm steadily builds up to the new opening at 0:43, where two sirens blare eerily, representing the Manhattan Project theme in its full glory. The creepy background Hans Zimmer-esque electronic wailing in the background only adds to the implicit horror of the scene in the actual movie. Violins speak again as ticking leads up to another buildup and release in 1:11. Now, three themes are playing, with the Los Alamos motif gently using ticking and strings to set the rhythm, Kitty theme leading the melody, and Manhattan Project creating some background support. This more or less continues until the end, and the wailing violins close the track before the 3rd minute rings.

The second third of the soundtrack again functions like a narrative; the musical themes for the Manhattan Project, Kitty, Julius and Lewis find their development like the plot in the “rising action” section.

American Prometheus. A joint development of Fission and Can You Hear The Music. Strings play in a more confident, but ultimately still subdued way, as the lead, harrowing two-note is supported by background violins. J.R. is trying to find himself as a scientist in the military world, but ends up trying to be both. So Isidor Rabi tells him to “be himself, but better”, and Oppenheimer suits up in his trademark outfit. The score picks up on this as the synths and tempo-shifting strings enter the audio plane, marking Robert’s return “to the form”. He’s now back in his element, though as the final, once again subdued section suggests, he will forever be changed by it.

Atmospheric Ignition. This one was very hard to properly analyze on album, and on my second viewing of the film I found out why. The piece was explicitly put together in the album. The second half, which is the ominous four note thumping, relates to the atmospheric ignition theory Oppenheimer and Einstein discuss. The first, which is mostly strings and synths playing in a subdued but eerie manner, plays during Teller's H-Bomb proposal, intro to Strauss' H-Bomb miniarc and the meeting between Julius and President Harry Truman. And both parts work well for the scenes they're in, but end up quite jarring in the album.

Los Alamos. Now that the town has been established, it's time for the authorities to take reigns. And the top dog in LAS was Oppenheimer. It's no wonder, then, that as Strauss describes J. R. as the town's sheriff in the scene the score accompanies, the Los Alamos theme gives off law, or even military-like vibes. With the scene cutting to Julius and Kitty entering LAS the score blares the Kitty, Los Alamos and Manhattan Project themes in a masterful trio once again, and one really gets the feeling of the scene: the town's scientist sheriff has moved in with his wife to build a weapon of mass destruction.

Fusion revives Strauss’ theme in a more grim and serious fashion. The rhythm is punctuated by the strings, which use the bows hitting the actual strings to simulate drums, a brilliant move by Goransson. The violins and the harp perform the 9 note motif from A Lowly Shoe Salesman both alternately and simultaneously. This continues with some new string sections entering at 0:55 well until 1:30, when the harp, still carrying the 9 note, is joined by incredibly atmospheric cellos, that segway with the two note theme in a truly malicious manner. The two notes engulf the entire song, as new instruments, including some woodwinds and the bows hitting the strings, slowly enter the picture. 2:24 has the fiddles continue the buildup, with the lower notes going only through the woodwinds. 3:08 marks a sound blast as the orchestra blares fully, with the woodwinds yelling the two notes alarmingly as the score achieves thematic and auditory perfection. After this ecstatic release the theme slows down and only the bow-punctuated cellos drive it to its end. The scene accompanying this track in the movie is made all the better by it.

Colonel Pash might quite possibly be the creepiest fella in the entire movie, and his theme shares the honor of being the creepiest piece of music. Though, in all honesty, the lead in this song is the main Oppenheimer theme, once again. The two-note. Except it’s very distorted and fearful. And it’s easy to mistake it for the actual Pash theme, which key is much lower, but still ominous. The leitmotifs overlap and play in tandem. The overall tempo and instrumental layout of the truck adds a kind of a Russian feel to it, which is all the fitting considering Pash’s origin. A short interlude in the middle soon loops us back to the reprise of the first part at 3:03, with some additional ticking. The Oppenheimer-Jean theme makes a reappearance at the very end. 

Theorists have horrifying imaginings, as Oppenheimer himself says. And now they have to imagine dropping the nukes on Japan, as the Germans surrender. This is worse than anything else for Oppenheimer, and his paranoically strained theme in the opening conveys this to a tee. Then, it segways into a more familiar territory with the piano, the synths and the strings. And then we hear The Music Again. It's more distorted, though, because now we're really using the wonders of science to destroy lives. The tense and unsure vibe of the song blends wonderfully with the still upbeat tones of Can You Hear The Music.

Ground Zero is basically a track unlike any other. It introduces the atomic bomb theme and that is mostly it. The fact that it uses a range of electronics different from what we’re able to hear in other parts of the score makes it all the more unique. You really get the feeling the Manhattan Project crew is in the final phase of their project. The Kitty theme makes a short reappearance when Oppenheimer tells his wife about the sheets in case they succeed.

Trinity provides another unique theme… for the test itself, that is. The strings play without a moment of pause for 5 minutes or so, the only support being occasional bell rings and a trombone insert, which has the Oppenheimer two note theme performed in its arguably most tense and impressive fashion yet. The tension ramps up as the strings enter higher pitches and faster tempos until a critical point is reached. The subsequent millisecond of silence (which in the movie was a minute or so) is immediately interrupted as Fission makes a fluid reprisal. The Groves theme slides in later with extreme grace as it plays in tandem with Oppenheimer’s harrowing strings; at this point both men know a new era has begun. It is nothing short of admirable how well triumph and eeriness overlap in this final section of the piece, perfectly expressing the terror and hope that nuclear weapons’ creation represented.

The final third of the score finishes the story of sounds like a proper third act, concluding the musical themes introduced and developed early on, bringing forth their final, evolved form.

What We Have Done is a harrowing re-examination of Gravity Swallows Light, with a touch of Lacrimosa thrown in due to its tempo. The slow, pensive and thoughtful increase in the music’s intensity drops down a bit with synthesizers slowly helping in the background from 2:09 to 3:22, and the buildup picks up from there to erupt violently in a cacophony at 4:09 to gradually melt into the consequences/Jean theme. The music works wonders for the speech scene it was used in tandem with. The eerie, grotesque, sorrowful tones fit it to a tee. The synth version of the two notes for the first time cries out in pain at 5:15, a truly heartwrenching sound; the sound of a defeated genius, of a defeated man.

Power Stays In The Shadows, and so did the song's purpose for some time in my eyes. While it did of course play to the quote-related Strauss scene, on my second viewing I heard it clearly during Jean's ""death"" and Robert's reaction. Because this piece is as much Strauss's victory as it is Oppenheimer's failure. Even if the harp, the leading instrument, is skewed towards Lewis rather than Julius. But the theme itself is LS through and through, now revealing the third facet of the character: in A Lowly Shoe Salesman we met Strauss the wronged and insecure old hand, in Fusion we met Strauss the angry opponent, here, we meet Strauss the hateful schemer. Especially the strings convey this, performing the two note in a mischievously malicious manner, playing it unbroken so it feels more like a glissando than anything. The tones of Oppenheimer’s defeat sound again at 2:20, and the harrowing violin appears in a couple more ways until the end. The music descends into straight up gloom in its final minute, you really get the end times vibe as judgement hangs above Julius’ head.

The Trial. This track first plays - or at least its opening notes do - in a hybrid between it and Fusion after the terror-speech-vision scene in Los Alamos as Strauss explains Oppenheimer’s political tactics post 1945 and the fate of his would-be-communist former friends. The whole theme alternates between its own mood, Strauss’ and Oppenheimer’s, as different instruments and rhythms belonging to each party overlap and intertwine gracefully, flawlessly carrying the interrogation mode, which is basically the best way to describe the scene in the actual movie. The mood changes in 1:29 and quiets down to Oppenheimer’s peaceful synths at 1:57, then regains its strong foothold in 2:57 as the Strauss bow hits go in hard in tango with Oppenheimer’s violin. The regular trial theme swings back in 3:21, then we go back to the previous “battle” mode, synths taking over the equation completely with strings doing the rest of the groundwork. And then they segway into the last minute’s particularly grim build up.

Dr. Hill changes the game completely, sound and plot wise. This feeling of novelty, of the tide turning is carried by the piano, the harp and the strings. The Oppenheimer theme can be heard too, with the synths quietly murmuring in the backdrop. The strings intensify from 1:07 on, as the piano carries over strong. Then the synths explicitly switch to Hill’s theme as he spells out Strauss’ undoing in the movie through comprehensive and clear testimony. A more peaceful section takes the charge at 2:19, clearly belonging to Oppenheimer again. A more uneasy vibe enters as General Groves testifies for Julius losing his security clearance, and the somber violins and piano ring again. Something has been lost. Thankfully, Groves completes his testimony with the reassurance that JR is no communist, and so Groves’ theme closes the piece as Oppenheimer’s ally brings him closer to “victory”.

Kitty Comes To Testify, and man oh man, what a scene (and scenes) and a song that is. The subdued, slow piano drives the melody at first, as Kitty answers the questions. And from then on, it’s all just rising. Ms. Oppenheimer gains more and more strength over her interlocutors/interrogators through her quick wits and solid logic, with the tunes reflecting that perfectly well. Even without the movie in front of you, you can basically HEAR the story in there. A truly beautiful conclusion to a character that was done justice, a shame that only in the last third of the movie. The theme slows down as Oppenheimer and Einstein discuss the possible abandonment of America due to its treatment of the former. Once again, the emotion is palpable, as you feel the electronics pondering together with the main character. But Julius Oppenheimer refuses to leave America, to reject her, he loves her too much. And that statement is Oppenheimer’s final step towards victory. At 3:13 the two note synth clamors in relief; the main character has “prevailed” in a sense. Then it goes quiet as soon as it sounded, angry bow strings barging like Strauss barging in and melting down in defeat. Yes, ladies and gentlemen, this is THE scene. There is a tangible denial in the strings, as if Strauss was pouring his thoughts into the music, as if the tones themselves couldn’t believe he was somehow one-upped by a member of Oppenheimer’s “clique”. The denial quickly shifts into brewing fury between 3:48 and 3:52, and a couple more seconds later the malicious two note theme is heard. The harp is heard in the background, the wailing violins return with a vengeance, and even the foot stomping - the foot stomping - makes an actual appearance in the score as the build up accompanies Strauss melting down in rage and Roger Robb launching one final attack on Oppenheimer until the scientist utters his final wham line and the music ceases.

Something More Important was initially a track I couldn’t easily understand due to a lack of clear thematic point introduced earlier it was basing itself off of; then, thankfully, I found some similarities with Jean’s theme, which of course turned out to be in fact the consequences theme in the end. All in all, a perfectly fine bookends theme.

Destroyer of Worlds. The final aspect of Oppenheimer’s theme is introduced through the harp, as it plays in succeeding three notes, sometimes slipping into fours. This very sad but peaceful auditory scene is soon joined by the violin, which, of course, plays the harrowing two notes a couple of times. The two-note synth then takes over, flooding the track with an ominous, suspenseful tone - it’s Can You Hear The Music, except I Can’t Hear The Music. Not Anymore. Now I hear, now he hears, the trumpets of apocalypse. As the music once again accelerates rapidly, the main character is again realizing something - but the conclusion is rather depressing as J. Robert Oppenheimer envisions a nuclear arms race eventually ending in a firestorm that ignites the worlds and burns it. Everything is here. Fear, paranoia, anger, self-loathing, despair, pain, shame, resignation, fright, melancholy, panic. And then… Silence.

Oppenheimer. The synthesis. Once again, everything is here. The peaceful three-note synths, the harrowing two-note violins, the two-note synths. It is the ultimate description of the man himself, Julius Robert Oppenheimer. The film has concluded its plot and its final musical theme. And now it is time for me to conclude this analysis.

oppenheimer	TrueFilm	16a7ymz	1693870719	On the stereotypes in Barbie (2023), the contradiction of the film in alleviating stereotype	"I'm sure many of you are aware of the viral trend “Barbenheimer” and you might have already watched both instances. The article aims to elucidate some of my observations after viewing “Barbie,” not Oppenheimer as the Nolan pieces are notoriously difficult to deconstruct, and I'm conscious of my incompetence in commenting on them. As readers, you might already be wondering why am I discussing a trend that is waning?

Admittedly, I was hesitant to watch “Barbie” after hearing certain critiques and subsequently forming a negative impression about it. The fact that I prejudged an idea without examining it firsthand, as was the case with watching “Barbie” myself, is regrettable. Thus, I am grateful for the opportunity that allowed me to chance upon watching it and reshaping my perspectives.

The purpose of this essay is to delve into one of the central themes in “Barbie,” namely stereotypes, and to illustrate the performative contradiction presented in the film.It is not to criticize and label the film, as such actions can inadvertently contribute to the creation of stereotypes and impressions.

It is evident that the film “Barbie” attempts to address the theme of stereotypes as seen in the choice of the protagonist, Stereotype Barbie. However, following my viewing of the movie, I argue that while it aimed to challenge stereotypes, it fell short of providing a comprehensive depiction and, paradoxically, contributed to the construction of additional stereotypes.

Spoiler alert! The story commences with the stereotypical Barbie waking up and beginning her day in Barbieland. Here the film presents typical cliché impressions of the Barbie world: everywhere is adorned in pink, as if it were the favored color shared by all girls. Ken, another protagonist, attempts to capture Barbie's attention portraying it as the innate nature of men.

The story reaches its climax when Barbie plans to take over Kenland. Sasha's mother rants and raves on the unrealistic social expectation placed on her which inspires brainwashed Barbies and prompts them to awaken from subordination.

The film highlighted the set of stereotypes imposed on females by society. It suggested, through the advancement of the plot and the element of self-reflexivity, that females should awaken and combat it after the recognition of the absurdity of the set of rules.


However, the very motion to subvert fabricated stereotypes in the film inevitably generates another impression among the audience which is characterized by “Wokeism” where individuals are alert to prejudice and discrimination among different groups, in this case between different genders.

Moreover, several aspects of the film served to subtly reinforce existing stereotypes, particularly if audiences are unaware of it. For instance, the film shapes a wise image of Ruth Handler, the woman who advised Barbie at last and it aligns with the generalized stereotype of a wise individual: aged, wrinkled and white-haired. Another example is the casting choice and the use of cosmetics, with each character presented to appeal to the audiences. Even the “Weird Barbie” was dressed up beautifully as opposed to the ugly narration in the film. This contrast aims to appeal to the audiences for reaching emotional congruence.

It is inevitable that information becomes distorted, reduced and reinterpreted through media transmission. As said in media ecology, ""the medium is the message"". It is impossible to faithfully present the whole picture without distortion. The idea put forward in Barbie in the form of a movie is altered when viewed in the lens of the medium itself, namely movie. The underlying predicament lies in “Barbie” intending to subvert stereotypes within a media where stereotypes are inherently created.

I would reiterate my intention again not to condemn the film in its whole. In fact I found many details of the film intriguing, such as the use of color scheme to achieve visual harmony and elicit matching emotions. My aim is to offer an alternate analytical approach to comprehending the film and fostering critical discussions."	/r/TrueFilm/comments/16a7ymz/on_the_stereotypes_in_barbie_2023_the/	https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/16a7ymz/on_the_stereotypes_in_barbie_2023_the/
oppenheimer	flicks	15qby8r	1691964815	"""Oppenheimer"" (2023) is an incredible film with superb direction, acting, script, special effects, set design, and so forth."	"I went to see, ""Oppenheimer"" a few days ago. I had not seen any other Nolan films save for Inception and the Dark Knight Trilogy, the latter being some of my favourite films of all time.

If I may be honest, I had a blast. Such a wonderfully put together piece of a film.

The story recounts the tale of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a Jewish scientist credited as, 'the father of the atomic bomb'. The film portrays his education, his work in Los Alamos on the atomic bomb and the interrogation he had to face from the Intelligence.

Now, first off, I have to mention the direction. Nolan has often been accused of overly self-indulgent. His films often feature content that some may deem superflous. He relies on impressive imagery or unorthodox sound mixing to tell the story, which may be seen as pretentious. However, with this film, I think Nolan has really come into his own. The direction is outstanding and on point.

The acting in the film is truly tremendous. I have to give special praise to Cillian Murphy's portrayal of Oppenheimer. He brings life to his character like few others could. However, the list does not end here. Robert Downey Junior, for one, is also magnificent.

I think I see quite a lot of Kubrick in this film, especially Doctor Strangelove and 2001: a Space Odyssey. I am glad that Nolan is so capable at copying the greatest director of all time.

I love how the film portrays Oppenheimer's life and how he comes to regret his work on the bomb. Especially the scenes with Einstein by the pond make one reconsider things. For, by spreading nuclear weapons around the world, we have truly foomed ourselves.

I think it's a wonderful film thag touches on important topics and is proof of Nolan's ability as director. I was quite surprised by how goid it was. To be honest, I am quite surprised it has not been met with more of a widespread critical acclaim.

oppenheimer	TrueFilm	15nwapt	1691721308	Where Oppenheimer missed the mark.	"I think Oppenheimer was an okay movie, certainly not bad. However,  I think it could have been alot better. My problems are as followed:

Stakes in the Third Act: The third act felt a bit disconnected, focusing on the nomination hearing and Oppenheimer's potential loss of security clearance. While a line was added about the potential loss of their house, it didn't seem to resonate as strongly. Historical figures like Groves also lost their security clearances, and it wasn't necessarily a career-ending move. Moreover, Oppenheimer's portrayal didn't give me the impression that he was deeply concerned about his public reputation, which made the entire arc feel less impactful.

Character Development: The film could have delved deeper into the personas of key figures. While we are told about Oppenheimer's brilliance, it would have been more effective to see it in action. I was curious about his relationship with Kitty and the reasoning behind certain decisions, such as poisoning his professor. The film had potential avenues for character exploration but seemed to sidestep them.

Technical Details of the Manhattan Project: One aspect I missed was the intricate details of the Manhattan Project. Real-life challenges faced during the creation of the bomb could have provided an engaging narrative. Notable figures like Von Neumann and Feynman, who played crucial roles, were surprisingly absent. Scenes portraying events like the RaLa Experiments and the Demon Core could have added more depth.

Representation of the Bomb Detonation: The visual portrayal of the bomb's explosion seemed underwhelming. Given the significance of this event, a more realistic representation would have heightened its impact.

Overlooking Oppenheimer's Spirituality: The use of the Bhagavad Gita felt superficial. The parallels between Arjuna's dilemma in the Gita and Oppenheimer's moral quandary are striking, and exploring this could have added a rich layer of depth. Instead, the profound meaning behind the scripture seemed to be overshadowed by its use in a misplaced scene.

It really wish this film had be given to David Fincher instead of Nolan."	/r/TrueFilm/comments/15nwapt/where_oppenheimer_missed_the_mark/	https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/15nwapt/where_oppenheimer_missed_the_mark/
oppenheimer	TrueFilm	15fw1b5	1690942507	"What were Oppenheimer's ""reasons""?"	"Overall, I liked Oppenheimer. I've watched it twice and enjoyed it both times and. Not Nolan's biggest fan but Oppenheimer is on the best films I've seen this year list.

I've been wandering about a scene, towards the end, where Kitty and their lawyer are criticising Oppenheimer for basically taking the beating he is receiving from the closed kangaroo court judging his security clearance renewal and wanting to ""be the martyr"". He's talking to his lawyer outside their house. The lawyer, I think, asks him why he is going through this willingly. Oppie replies that he has his own reasons. What are those reasons? Is it a masochistic impulse within him that wishes to be punished somehow for bringing the atom bomb into existence? An embrace of his fate as Prometheus tied to the rock as his punishment for giving man the power to destroy himself? I'm curious to know what his reasons are, or what any of you interpret his reasons to be."	/r/TrueFilm/comments/15fw1b5/what_were_oppenheimers_reasons/	https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/15fw1b5/what_were_oppenheimers_reasons/
oppenheimer	TrueFilm	15d5u5a	1690672362	"Is Oppenheimer an example of ""shooting and crying?"""	"I got out of the theatre from Oppenheimer a few hours ago and I've been processing my feelings about the film. I think it is one of the best American films since *The Master* (PTA, 2012), and loved every moment of it. There was an aspect of the film that was nagging me though.

In Israeli film studies, there is a term called ""shooting and crying"" which typically designates films made within Isreal about the occupation of Palestine which showcases war crimes and atrocities committed by former IDF members (typically against Palestinian civilians) who showcase remorse for their actions. *Waltz with Bashir* (Ari Folman, 2008) would be a prominent example of the genre. While specifically considered an Israeli occurrence, we can see something similar in American war films about Vietnam. A big aspect of this occurrence is that it privileges the perspective of the oppressor against the oppressed (again, think Isreal to Palestine).

My question is does Oppenheimer, a film in part about the man who led the Manhattan Project, an example of this phenomenon? He builds the bomb (in part to use against Nazi Germany), gives it to the military who then uses it on Japanese civilians, and feels remorse for it for the rest of his life. It feels very in line with the ethos of those other films.

Now I am trying to say this is something that makes the film worse; the absence of Japanese perspectives and how casually they, as intended targets of the bomb, are treated is a major point of the film. Likewise, it is also demonstrated that Oppenheimer himself feels alone in remorse considering the scene at Los Alamos where everyone cheers at the success of the bomb, further honing in on the horrors of jingoism and inhumanity couched by distance. Yet it is also intentional in those Israeli works as well, so I think it is worth investigating. So what do you think?

P.S. This is also likewise not asking for Oppenheimer to also have an extended sequence of Japanese perspectives about the bomb. *Hiroshima* (Hideo Sekigawa, 1953), *Children of Hiroshima* (Kaneto Shindō, 1952), and multiple Barefoot Gen and Gojira films exist and can be easily watched by those curious."	/r/TrueFilm/comments/15d5u5a/is_oppenheimer_an_example_of_shooting_and_crying/	https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/15d5u5a/is_oppenheimer_an_example_of_shooting_and_crying/

oppenheimer	TrueFilm	15a6vmk	1690380524	Oppenheimer as an indictment on the professional managerial class	"Was listening to the New York Times’ podcast Matter of Opinion and they made a very interesting point about Oppenheimer - that it is basically an indictment on the professional managerial class and the core message of the film is that Oppenheimer, as stand in for the class, is not actually a decision maker; has inflated self importance; and is indirectly responsible for the suffering his work enables. 

I think the choice to show zero of the combat footage we are used to in WWII period films and *especially* the choice to show none of the destruction of Hiroshima or Nagasaki - in one scene Oppenheimer is viewing photos of the destruction (and looking away!) but we, the viewer, are not - is key here. Much of the entire movie takes place in sterile academic or laboratory environments. Building the bomb is an intellectual exercise, not something that will result in the deaths of thousands. A middle manager working in, say, Nike HQ could be forgiven for not thinking very hard about the sweat shops his work enables. Who is ultimately responsible? Was Oppenheimer “just following orders”?

The moment Oppenheimer builds Fat Man and Little Boy there’s a real feeling of deflation, disillusionment, disempowerment. A soldier chastises his continued concern with a, “No offense, but we’ve got it from here.” Did Oppenheimer ever really have any power or control? Someone smarter than me could look at this through a Marxist lens; the professional managerial class is educated, earns a high wage, and has the illusion of control - but they don’t own the means of production. 

Apologies for not fleshing this out very much (I’m at work, which ironically is part of the professional managerial class) but I think it’s an interesting topic worthy of discussion."	/r/TrueFilm/comments/15a6vmk/oppenheimer_as_an_indictment_on_the_professional/	https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/15a6vmk/oppenheimer_as_an_indictment_on_the_professional/

Nolan once again tries too hard to camouflage his weakness of characters and dialogues with an audio-visual feast and mashing trillions of timelines but fails again. An example of Nolan's best and worst traits. He is so smart and witty but a slave to his own style. film is like a huge drawn-out montage with no breaks feels like a 3 hr trailer where there's no space for any theme, any character to breath. Nolan hardly gives subject matter the peace and quiet it actually needed. 

The man who literally cried on television because of Hiroshima, Nagasaki. i didn't get to see any kind of such remorse or inner turmoil throughout the film beyond the closeups of sunken eyes of Cillian murphy who is acting like a demon. deserves all the praise. 

overstretched last act of McCarthyism romp just to build that Einstein twist at the end was just too exhausting for me.

In case anyone's still going to post on this, I'm not counting movies that get really dark and you're glad you're not in that position and that's it. That's just a dark movie. The movie *has* to carry you into the positive, or at least heavily imply it.

With that said, here's the list I've compiled from the comments. Despite my best efforts, there's likely several repeats, but I did my best to also sift out ones where I personally disagree or just plain feel like it's trolling. I haven't seen anywhere near all these movies, so proceed with the appropriate level of skepticism, but I like a lot of what I've found.

sound_of_freedom	movies	1ibm00p	1738016631	January 24-26 Box Office Recap: In a very quiet weekend, 'Flight Risk' tops the box office, but poor reviews and word of mouth will prevent it from holding well. 'Presence' has an okay start in 1,750 theaters, while 'Brave the Dark' flops outside the Top 10.	"https://preview.redd.it/hjr42iwe3mfe1.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0bea2ede539c39f9000b3f9661915c8e54fee033

In one of the quietest weekends (it's January after all), ***Flight Risk*** seized the opportunity to top the box office. The weekend's other new release was Neon's ***Presence***, which had a soft start in less than 2,000 theaters. But the real loser was Angel Studios' ***Brave the Dark***, which flopped with one of the worst debuts in 2,000 theaters.

The Top 10 earned a combined $54.2 million this weekend. That's up 30.1% from last year, when ***Mean Girls*** repeated on the top spot for a third week.

Debuting in 3,161 theaters, Lionsgate's ***Flight Risk*** earned $11.5 million this weekend. That's star Mark Wahlberg's biggest debut since ***Uncharted*** ($44 million), and his biggest for a non-IP since ***Instant Family*** ($18 million). Although for director Mel Gibson, this is his lowest debut as director since ***Man Without a Face*** ($4 million) back in 1993.

This is an okay, not great start. The production kept the budget low at $25 million and it clearly shows, given the film is mostly set in a plane with only three characters. And perhaps that's why the film didn't make a huge landing here; it simply lacks an interesting hook. The plot gave streaming vibes and the film's tone (the tagline is ""Y'all need a pilot?"") suggested it this was going to be a non-event. It's simply a film that people saw a few times already.

There's also a problem regarding star power. Wahlberg is clearly well known, but his name has taken a dive in the past years. Most of his films in the past years have flopped, with ***Uncharted*** becoming the rare box office hit (and that's because of the IP). Michelle Dockery (who also starred in another plane thriller, ***Non-Stop***, back in 2014) and Topher Grace aren't big names that draw people to theaters either. And Lionsgate decided to avoid showcasing Gibson's involvement from marketing, choosing to use ""from the director of ***Braveheart***, ***Apocalypto*** and ***Hacksaw Ridge***"" as its selling point. While Gibson is often considered a great filmmaker, this was a miss: it's sitting at an awful 25% on RT.

According to Lionsgate, 54% of the audience was male and 55% was 25 and over. Critics hated the film and audiences agreed; they gave it an awful ""C"" on CinemaScore, which is simply terrible for an action thriller. With other thriller/action films like ***Companion*** and ***Love Hurts*** coming up, this film is heading for a freefall. For now, a $25 million domestic total is likely, which will make it Gibson's least attended film as director.

***Mufasa*** dipped 29%, adding $8.5 million this weekend. That takes its domestic total to $220.9 million, and it should get close to $250 million by the end of its run.

Sony's ***One of Them Days*** eased just 32%, adding $8 million this weekend. That's a very great hold for a comedy, indicating word of mouth is strong with this one. Through ten days, the film has earned $25.1 million domestically, and it should finish with over $40 million.

In fourth place, ***Sonic the Hedgehog 3*** eased 38%, adding $5.3 million. That takes its domestic total to $225.9 million.

***Moana 2*** eased just 30%, adding $4.1 million this weekend. The film has amassed $449.9 million so far.

In sixth place, Neon's ***Presence*** debuted with $3.3 million in 1,750 theaters. That's Steven Soderbergh's worst debut in wide release, below ***Unsane*** ($3.7 million). But this result is not surprising. At least it was above Neon's recent horror ***Cuckoo*** ($3 million).

Soderbergh has pivoted from theatrical releases, with ***Magic Mike's Last Dance*** making his first theatrical film since 2018. In those years, he has gone on to release films for Netflix and Max instead. Neon chose to save costs and avoid releasing it too wide, feeling that Soderbergh's brand could carry it. But it looks like in a sea of horror/thrillers like ***Nosferatu***, ***Wolf Man*** and ***Companion***, this one simply got lost in the shuffle.

According to Neon, 56% of the audience was male and 73% was 25 and over. They gave it a ""C+"" on CinemaScore, which isn't surprising, considering the marketing sells a different film. It's unlikely ***Presence*** can leg it out to $10 million lifetime.

After its weak debut, Blumhouse's ***Wolf Man*** dropped to seventh place, earning $3.2 million. That's a very awful 70% drop from last weekend, far worse than ***The Invisible Woman*** (46.3%) and it's also slightly worse than 2010's ***The Wolfman*** (68.6%). Well, considering the film's tepid response and poor word of mouth, that's not really surprising. Through ten days, the film has earned just $17.6 million, and it will close with just $22 million at most.

Searchlight's ***A Complete Unknown***, coming off its 8 Oscar nominations, had the best drop in the Top 10. It eased a light 18%, adding $3 million this weekend. With that, the film's domestic total now stands at $62.9 million.

In ninth place, ***Den of Thieves: Pantera*** fell a further 55% this weekend, adding $2.9 million. The film has earned $31.8 million, and will now officially close below $40 million domestically.

Rounding up the Top 10 was A24's ***The Brutalist***, coming off its 10 Oscar nominations. It finally hit wide release in 1,118 theaters, and the film earned $2.8 million this weekend. That's a fine start, especially considering its 215-minute runtime limited the amount of screenings. With this, the film's domestic lifetime stands at $9.3 million, and it's gonna continue legging out.

After 10 weekends, ***Wicked*** has finally left the Top 10. But it still eased 34%, adding $2.3 million this weekend and taking its domestic total to $468.7 million.

It's not until the 12th spot where we find Angel Studios' ***Brave the Dark***, which flopped with $2.2 million in 2,230 theaters. That's one of the worst debuts for any film at over 2,000 theaters, and marks another loss for Angel Studios, which has been failling to find a success after ***Sound of Freedom***.

***Nosferatu*** fell 52%, adding $1.9 million this weekend. The film's domestic total stands at $93.1 million, and it looks like it might take some time in reaching $100 million.

***September 5*** expanded to 395 theaters this weekend, earning just $745,064. The film has earned only $1.6 million, and with the lack of awards prospects, it's going to disappear quickly.

After a very confusing platform release, Amazon MGM finally expanded ***Nickel Boys*** into 540 theaters, just as it received 2 Oscar noms. But the film earned just $348,060, which is very low. That took its domestic total to $1.5 million, and it needs some strong word of mouth to leg out.

IFC Films released Neil Burger's new action thriller ***Inheritance*** in 627 theaters, and it flopped with an abysmal $124,817. That's the 13th worst debut for a film playing in over 600 theaters, and it also translates to a putrid $199 per-theater average. It will fade quickly.

#**OVERSEAS**

***Mufasa*** once again led the foreign box office. It added $15.4 million, taking its worldwide total to $627 million. The best markets are France ($38.1M), UK ($34.7M), Mexico ($28.3M), Germany ($27.8M) and Italy ($23.1M).

***Sonic the Hedgehog 3*** added $10.6 million this weekend, taking its worldwide total to $446.3 million. The best markets are the UK ($28.9M), Mexico ($21.1M), France ($18.4M), Australia ($17.1M) and Brazil ($12.3M).

Ahead of its American debut in February, ***Paddington in Peru*** added $6.3 million this weekend, taking its overseas total to $83 million.

***Moana 2*** added $5.8 million, taking its worldwide total to $1.026 billion. The best markets are France ($61.8M), UK ($51.2M), Germany ($44M), Australia ($31.8M) and Japan ($31.6M).

***Nosferatu*** added $4.2 million, and its worldwide total is now $166.5 million. The best markets are the UK ($14.7M), Mexico ($7.8M), Germany ($5.3M), Spain ($5.1M) and Italy ($5.1M).

#**FILMS THAT ENDED THEIR RUN THIS WEEK**

Movie | Release Date | Studio | Domestic Opening | Domestic Total | Worldwide Total | Budget |
----------|----------|----------|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:
*Red One* | Nov/15 | Amazon MGM | $32,106,112 | $97,000,759 | $185,895,441 | $250M
*Better Man* | Dec/25 | Paramount | $1,063,901 | $1,983,648 | $13,504,215 | $110M

- The hierarchy of power in the Christmas Cinematic Universe didn't change at all. For ***Red One***, it closed with just $185 million, far below it's $250 million budget. Even if it was supposed to be on streaming, it's still underwhelming that the film couldn't hit $200 million worldwide or $100 million domestically. Is The Rock a draw? Certainly. Does that warrant a high budget? Look up here and ***Black Adam***. 

- Well, this shit is bananas. B-A-N-A-N-A-S. Paramount simply gave up with ***Better Man*** after just 2 weeks in wide release; it will continue playing in who knows how many theaters, but they decided to stop reporting box office numbers. And so the film couldn't hit $2 million domestically. There are a few foreign markets left, but it has zero chance of making a comeback. Very disappointing.

#**THIS WEEKEND**

DreamWorks is returning to the big screen with ***Dog Man***, which is based on Dav Pilkey's children's graphic novel series, and is also a spin-off and story within a story of *Captain Underpants: The First Epic Movie*. As the first family animated film (get out of the way, ***Mufasa***) since ***Moana 2***, this has so much on its favor and should easily top the box office.

Another release is WB's ***Companion***, which follows a a weekend getaway among friends at a remote cabin, which unravels into chaos after a revelation that one of the guests is a companion robot. The marketing has been very resistant in showing more of the plot, choosing instead to emphasize its connection to ***Barbarian*** (Zach Cregger is a producer here). With some great reviews so far (94% on RT), perhaps it could surprise.

sound_of_freedom	movies	1dg4qrc	1718408836	Action film fans - check out Life After Fighting (2024)	"Life After Fighting is a direct-to-video action film from Australia, starring a 47-year-old martial artist named Bren Foster (he's been in a few DTV films before, most notably Deep Blue Sea 3 (yes, there were 3) as the villain).

The IMBD logline is: A martial arts instructor is confronted with the disappearance of two of his students, leading him into a direct confrontation with a group of international child traffickers.

Sure, sounds 'Sound of Freedom-ish', but it couldn't be less political. And don't let the terrible title and poster fool you. We get a few two thirds that admittedly are a bit slow with flashes of martial artistry set in the main character's martial arts school, but the last third sets up a siege at said school and it is 40 minutes of insanity once that point hits.

Bren Foster is a tank, the cinematography and editing is done in a way that really lets you see what's going on in the fights, and there are some brutal endings to some of the encounters - throats ripped, bones broken, brains bashed.

It would have been better if it was edited more tightly (clocks in at 2 hours, could have easily been 90 minutes) but the last third is worth watching for. Awesome fight scenes, and you'll definitely wonder why Bren Foster isn't bigger. I bet we'll see him in more things after this. The film suffers a bit from budgetary constraints, but in terms of action and fights, this flick delivers."	/r/movies/comments/1dg4qrc/action_film_fans_check_out_life_after_fighting/	https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1dg4qrc/action_film_fans_check_out_life_after_fighting/

sound_of_freedom	TrueFilm	16b21n0	1693952023	Attempting to understand the Sound of Freedom discourse.	"Yesterday I got around to watching the “*controversial*” Sound of Freedom it has a limited screening here in the UK, I had no real interest in watching it but my friend being from Columbia invited me to the screening as the topic and setting is very personal to her.

As we all know this is an independent film allegedly based on the true story of a government agents rescue mission of children caught in a child trafficking ring. It was completed 5 years ago but only finally got a release in 2023.

The film has proven hugely successful for and independent film currently sitting at $184M on a $14M budget however it has proven itself to be controversial and I’m not entirely sure why. 

It’s somehow found itself between the crux of US partisan politics, on one hand it’s been accused of spreading far-right conspiracy theories and on the other it’s “*lack of coverage*” has been weaponised by right wing loons as proof that the media is covering up a mysterious illuminati sex ring or whatever. 

Having seen the film I’m quite perplexed, without going too much into it, I thought the film was decent not great but it’s okay. As far as I’m concerned it’s relatively apolitical. It’s well written, acted, directed it has its message and it tells it well at times it was even quite moving at times(*my friend was reduced to tears at the end*) It’s not as sophisticated as I’d like it to be but it gets the job done. So what’s the big deal?

I think I have an idea I’m just guessing so bear with me.

 1. Independent films get shelved all the time due to not finding a distributer especially with a topic as heavy as child trafficking. 

2. Getting picked up by a Christian production house would lead it to it being ignored by most media outlets because christian films are usually functionally bad (*I’ve seen enough of them trust me*) 

3. Jim Caviezel and his wacky politics being the lead actor would always attract a **certain** audience and simultaneously put off another.

4.This creates a toxic scenario where the specific audience will accuse the msm of being lizard people or whatever because they won’t review the film, and the msm refusing cover the film because they assume it’s just some QAnon equivalent Triumphant of the Will.

The sad thing is, it’s generally a decent film with a strong message that needs to be told it’s just fascinating that it’s all been marred by the controversy. what are your thoughts?"	/r/TrueFilm/comments/16b21n0/attempting_to_understand_the_sound_of_freedom/	https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/16b21n0/attempting_to_understand_the_sound_of_freedom/
